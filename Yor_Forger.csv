name,line
Loid," Yeah, no."
Franky, What?!
Anya, Anya cannot accept this mama.
Loid," You're just not going to cut it for the mother role, Franky."
Franky, You're literally a spy. Couldn't you have done my disguise better?
Loid, There's only so much I can do with your height and physique.
Franky, I can't believe I volunteered for this!
Anya, Have a peanut.
Loid, Operation Strix.
Loid," In order to stop a key figure in Ostania, Desmond, from trying to start a w*r,"
Loid, I was given this top-secret mission as a member of WISE.
Loid," We were able to pass the written exam to get into the prestigious Eden College,"
Loid, but who knew the interview process's next stage demanded the attendance of both parents?
Loid, Very well.
Sign, SECURE A WIFE
Loid, I guess I'll have to explore my options.
Camilla, Did you hear? A thief might've entered our office.
Sign," Capital City Berlint, City Hall"
Camilla," Apparently, they only searched drawers with information regarding the girls."
Camilla," Like, what? What kind of creep does that?"
Millie," Honestly, the section chief is way creepier."
Millie, He's always ogling me.
Sharon, That's because you're always wearing those short skirts.
Millie," Well, my boyfriend likes it when I wear them."
Millie," You've got a nice figure yourself, Sharon, so flaunt it more."
Sharon, You don't bother anymore once you have a kid.
Camilla, So hey...
Camilla," What do you think about this, Yor? Isn't it creepy?"
Yor, Sorry?
Millie, Is that the section chief's coffee? Let's put some boogers in it.
Yor, Huh?
Yor, Do boogers somehow make it taste better?
Camilla," You know, Yor... I've gotta say you're rather..."
Camilla, unique.
Millie," I know, right?"
Millie, She's so out there that I bet guys keep their distance.
Sharon," Come on, now, Millie."
Camilla," You've got a nice face and body, Yor."
Camilla, You'd be a knockout if you just dressed up.
Yor, Uh-huh...
Millie, I'll give you the deets on some of my favorite cosmetics.
Yor, I'm honestly content as long as I get to keep this job.
Camilla," But aren't you, like, ? You need to be careful."
Camilla," There seem to be a lot of spies around lately, you know?"
Camilla, So people are apparently getting reported over the tiniest things.
Camilla," The other day, a single woman in her late twenties"
Camilla, got reported by her neighbors for being suspicious.
Millie," Wait, what? That's hilarious."
Millie," You know everything, Camilla."
Sharon," True, it's unheard of to be single at that age. Very suspicious."
Yor," Oh, I see. Thank you for the warning."
Camilla," Oh, yeah. I'm having a party at my place this weekend."
Camilla," You should totally come, Yor."
Camilla, Make sure you bring your partner with you.
Sharon, Isn't that asking a bit much?
Camilla, Maybe the creeper who snuck into this place will go with her.
Millie, That's so mean!
Yor," Hello, Briar residence."
Yuri," Hey, Sis. How have you been?"
Yor," Oh, Yuri."
Yuri, How's work going?
Yor, Don't worry. I'm still employed.
Yuri," I'm worried about you. You're kinda unusual, y'know."
Yor, How rude. I'm completely normal.
Yuri, Isn't it about time you got married?
Yuri, Anyone you're interested in?
Yor, This again?
Yuri," The thing is, there's a chance I might get promoted..."
Yuri, Meaning I'll probably be even busier running around than before.
Yuri," But I can't leave you alone like this,"
Yuri, so I'm not sure if I should take it.
Yuri," The whole reason I got this far is because of you, and I'm truly grateful."
Yuri, That's why I just want you to be happy.
Yor, I know.
Yor," Thank you, Yuri."
Yuri," If you want, I can introduce you to someone."
Yor," Huh? N-No, that's okay."
Yor," O-Oh, yes. I'm actually going to a party this weekend."
Yor," With my partner, of course."
Yuri, Huh? You have a boyfriend?
Yor," I do, actually..."
Yor, So don't worry.
Yuri," I see! That's great. It'll be a party with coworkers, right?"
Yor, Yup. Camilla's throwing it.
Yuri, Ah.
Yuri, Then I'll have to ask Dominic about the guy later.
Yor, Huh?
Yuri," I mean, I know how gullible you are."
Yuri, I'll have to chase him away if he's a loser.
Yor, Huh? Um...
Yuri, I'll hold off on this promotion until I know he's a good guy.
Yor," Oh, you don't need to do tha—"
Yuri, I look forward to meeting him. Goodnight.
Yor, What should I do?
Yor, I need to find someone by the time of the party.
Yor," If he finds out I'm lying, he'll think I'm a weirdo and a pathological liar,"
Yor, and he'll lose even more trust in me.
Yor, I need to find someone for the sake of my little brother's promotion.
Yor," Yuri, you've got the wrong idea! I was just joking earlier—"
Shopkeeper," Oh, dear. Did you buddy-buddy siblings actually have a quarrel?"
Yor," Oh, Shopkeeper?"
Yor," I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was you."
Shopkeeper," Good evening. I have a client for you, Thorn Princess."
Shopkeeper, The Royal Hotel.
Shopkeeper, Room .
Men in Black B," Apologies, my lady. This whole floor has been reserved."
Men in Black A, Did anyone call for this chick?
Men in Black C, Who knows?
Yor, But I've heard...
Yor, that a traitorous scumbag is staying here.
Brennan, What in the world?!
Men in Black C, It's an ambush! A lone woman—
Yor, Excuse me.
Yor," Vice Minister Brennan from the auditing department, I presume?"
Yor, I am terribly sorry if I interrupted anything...
Yor, But may I have the honor of taking your life?
Narrator, Code name: Thorn Princess.
Narrator, An assassin.
Narrator," She was taught the skills of her trade from a young age,"
Narrator, and has done any dirty work her employer requested ever since.
Yor, It's not coming off.
Yor," Huh? Oh, no! What shall I do?"
Yor, This is the only nice dress I own.
Yor, Now I can't go to the party.
flashback Yuri, Anyone you're interested in?
flashback Sharon, It's unheard of to be single at that age.
flashback Camilla, Make sure you bring your partner with you.
Yor, But it's hopeless.
Yor, When it comes to homemaking... Cleaning is the only thing I can do.
Anya, Scruffy Head!
Franky, I copied all the files of unmarried women from city hall.
Loid," Great, thanks."
Franky," You need one who won't care you're divorced with a kid,"
Franky," is refined enough for a prestigious school,"
Franky, and is willing to get married within hours?
Franky," If a goddess like that exists, I'd sure love to meet her."
Franky," Meanwhile, I'm not picky at all, yet I can't even get a date."
Loid, How unfortunate.
Franky," Don't pity me, assh*le!"
Anya, Is having a kid bad? Am I in the way?
Loid, You're not in the way at all.
Loid, Don't worry. Just go watch some TV.
Anya, 'Kay.
Franky," Actually, why don't you just use a female agent from your work?"
Loid," A lot of them got caught in the recent spy hunts, so I couldn't find a good match."
Bondman, Wake up! Hey!
Bondman, You... You won't get away with this!
Franky, Selling people out is really in right now.
Loid," We don't have enough agents, so I got another mission on top of this."
Loid, Eliminating a certain smuggling ring.
Franky, They're working you to the bone!
Franky, Let's just get this over with.
Franky, The quickest options would be women in bad circumstances who'd cooperate with you.
Franky," Finding dirt on them might help, too."
Franky," If they don't have any, we can always make some up."
Loid, I'd like to avoid anything risky.
Franky," Oh, please. She's plenty risky."
Franky, She definitely doesn't look like any princess from a rich family.
Anya, Push! Push!
Loid, You've got a point.
Loid, I need to at least do something about her appearance.
Proprietress," Now, young lady, I'm going to take your measurements. Come with me."
Anya, I'm being sold off somewhere!
Loid, You won't be if you behave.
Loid," Honestly, where does she learn to talk like that?"
Loid, The seamstress... is married.
Loid," The proprietress was listed among the single women,"
Loid," but she's been arrested once over political activities, so she's too dangerous."
Loid, Finding the right person might take longer than—
Yor, Pardon me.
Female Employee," Oh, I haven't seen you in a while, Yor."
Yor, Hello. I was hoping I could get my dress fixed up.
Yor, Could I get it done as quickly as possible?
Female employee, But of course. You're one of our regulars.
Loid, She managed to slip behind me so easily. Who is she?
Loid, Yor... Yor...
Loid, There we go.
Loid," Yor Briar, years old."
Loid, She has no record of being married or divorced.
Loid," Both of her parents are deceased,"
Loid, and she has one brother who's much younger than her.
Loid, They're both civil servants whose records are pretty clean.
Loid, Did I just let my guard down?
Loid, I'm far too relaxed lately.
Yor, Excuse me.
Yor, You've been staring at me ever since I walked in. May I help you?
Loid internal, Impossible! She could even sense my gaze?
Loid," Er, no, um, I'm sorry..."
Loid, I was just admiring how pretty you are.
Yor, Does that mean...
Yor, You have a favorable impression of my physical appearance?
Loid," Er, well... Yes."
Camilla," You've got a nice face and body, Yor."
Camilla, You'd be a knockout if you just dressed up.
Yor, Um—
Anya, Papa!
Anya, I now know how long I am!
Anya, Who's that?
Loid, Another customer.
Yor, He has a child.
Yor, I almost pursued someone's husband.
Yor, I've heard that women have been k*lled by wives for such things.
Yor," I mean, if it happened to me,I'd just k*ll them back..."
Anya, Huh?
Yor," No, I mustn't."
Yor," If I think like this, someone will eventually figure out that I'm an assassin."
Yor, I must learn to be more normal.
Anya, A-An assassin?!
Anya, A spy... An assassin...
Anya, I'm...
Anya, so excited!
Narrator, The little girl was starving for entertainment.
Loid," Hmm... I was considering her as a candidate to play my wife, but never mind."
Yor," I was considering him to act as my boyfriend at the party,"
Yor, but I must avoid these so-called messy lovers' quarrels.
Anya," Ah, I am oh so lonely because I do not have a mama."
Loid, What brought this on?
Anya, I long for a mama.
Yor, Are you not with your wife?
Loid," Oh, er..."
Loid," I actually lost my wife two years ago,"
Loid, so I'm raising her on my own now.
Yor, So I won't be k*lled for asking him to the party!
Yor, Excuse me...
Loid, Pretend to be your boyfriend?
Yor, Yes... I fibbed to my younger brother about having a boyfriend.
Yor," If it's not too much trouble, I was hoping you'd accompany me to this party."
Yor," Um, I promise I don't have any ulterior motives!"
Yor," Of course, I'll thank you properly, too."
Yor, I just want to put my brother's mind at ease.
Loid, Very well.
Loid, I accept.
Yor, Really?!
Loid, But I would like something in return.
Loid, So you see...
Loid, I'd like you to play the role of her mother during the interview.
Yor, Her mother?
Loid," With the future being so uncertain right now,"
Loid, my only wish is for my daughter to get into a good school.
Loid, This was also the wish of my late wife.
Anya, Papa is a liar.
Yor, What a wonderful person.
Loid Internal," I'll have her accept something simple first,"
Loid, It will only be one time. Would you be up for it?
Loid internal, but I'll get her to agree to a formal marriage in the end.
Yor, A-All right... If you think I'm fit for the role.
Loid, Thank you. Then let us reconvene at Saturday's party.
Yor, Yes.
Loid," I got a sitter for you on Saturday, so make sure you behave."
Anya, Stock up on them peanuts!
Loid," Yeah, yeah."
Cashier," Ten pents is your change, ribbit."
Cashier," Thanks, ribbit."
Anya, Ribbit?
Loid," A T... no, an F cipher."
Loid, Must be the details on the extra mission.
Loid, Retrieving art pieces that were stolen from the West and eliminating this smuggling ring.
Loid, I'm to carry out this mission Saturday at hours when the target meets with the buyer.
Loid, Saturday?
Loid, And so...
Loid, We're going to take care of this quickly so I can make it to the party.
Loid, You're helping.
Franky, Hang on a second! I'm just an informant! My fighting skills are literal trash!
Franky," Not to mention, you already pretty much capped your tab—"
Loid, We're talking art pieces valued at a total of three million dalcs.
Loid, I'm almost certain no one would notice if one or two happened to go missing.
Franky, Leave it to me.
Franky, I just so happen to have invented some new spy gear just for days like this.
Loid, He's so useful.
Yor, Loid is awfully late.
Yor, I hope he wasn't in some terrible accident.
Lackey A, Hold it!
Lackey B, Who're you workin' for?!
Franky, You didn't tell me there'd be an army of them!
Loid," Two, four, six... of them."
Loid, I can't afford to waste even ten seconds on each one!
Loid, Reinforcements! There's no end to them.
Franky, I got 'em all in! Get in!
Franky, Whoo!
Franky, Let's see... Which one's going to accidentally go missing?
Loid, I'm helping myself to this one.
Franky," Hey, that's a diamond! No fair taking the expensive-looking one!"
Loid, I'll use it as part of this whole charade.
Franky, Shut up! Give that back!
Yor, I see.
Yor, So this is what it means to have your heart toyed with.
Yor," I must keep my work relationships favorable for my brother's sake, too."
Yor, Which means that I must attend this party.
Camilla," You're late, Yor!"
Yor, I do apologize. Here's a gift.
Camilla, Oh? I thought you were coming with your boyfriend.
Yor," Unfortunately, he had something suddenly come up."
Camilla," Oh, what a shame. I was so eager to meet him!"
Camilla, What a lame excuse.
Millie, How pathetic.
Sharon, I knew she was lying about having a guy.
Millie, Should we report the liar?
Camilla, We should!
Camilla, I'm positive she's a spy who's been sent in to lower our country's birth rate.
Sharon, Seriously? That's so petty.
Sharon, She's just unpopular with the guys.
Sharon, Just leave her be.
Camilla," You're meaner than both of us, Sharon."
Dominic, It's too bad your boyfriend couldn't make it. I was excited to meet him.
Millie, You're so hilarious.
Yor, D-Dominic...
Dominic, Yuri's always so worried about you.
Yor," Um, could you possibly..."
Yor, just tell my brother than I came to the party with a kind gentleman?
Camilla," Yeah, not happening."
Camilla," Just how desperate are you to impress people, Yor?"
Camilla, It just makes you look even more pathetic.
Dominic," Jeez, knock it off, Camilla!"
Camilla, Stop talking to my man.
Camilla, I'll be sure to let your brother know that you came alone.
Yor, What could she possibly gain by doing that?
Yor, This is honestly becoming tiresome.
Yor," If all of the adults here just happened to perish,"
Yor, my brother would never find out...
Dominic, I'm so sorry. Have fun!
Dominic," Come on, Camilla. Help me bake this gratin."
Female Guest A, And then that guy...
Girl, Mommy!
Sharon, My oldest here will be taking an entrance exam soon.
Sharon, At the prestigious Eden College.
Female Guest B," Wow, that's wonderful!"
Male Guest A, He'll be a shoe-in with the elite.
Yor," That must be what ""normal"" looks like."
Yor, I'm sure that's how my brother wanted me to end up.
Camilla, Seriously? She's still here.
Millie, She's tougher than she looks.
Sharon, I'm honestly surprised she had the nerve to show up alone.
Yor, I see... I'm too out of my league here.
Yor, I do beg your pardon.
Yor, I will have to take my leav—
Loid, I'm terribly sorry for arriving late.
Loid," I'm Yor's husband, Loid Forger."
Yor, Um...
Yor," I just needed a boyfriend, not a husband."
Loid, sh*t!
Loid, I mixed up my mission with hers.
Dominic," Um... Mr. Forger, was it? You're bleeding."
Loid," Oh, pardon me."
Loid, One of my patients had a violent episode.
Loid, It happens all the time to a psychiatrist.
Loid," Have you been enjoying yourself, Yor?"
Camilla," You're joking, right?"
Camilla," You're married, Yor?"
Camilla, Why didn't you tell us?
Yor," Um, I..."
Loid," It's embarrassing to say so, but this is my second marriage and I already have a child,"
Loid, so it may have been hard to bring up.
Camilla, Don't give me that sh*t!
Loid, It's my fault.
Camilla, There's absolutely no way Yor has a husband who's that handsome and hot!
Camilla, I'll embarrass her in front of everyone!
Camilla," Yor, I just got this piping hot gratin right out of the oven!"
Camilla," Oops, I seemed to have tripped!"
Loid," I admire your dedication to not wasting food,"
Loid," but it's a bit improper to use your feet, Yor."
Yor," Oh, I'm so sorry."
Dominic, That got you?
Loid, This is quite delicious.
Yor, Indeed.
Camilla," Did you know, Mr. Ranger..."
Loid, It's Forger.
Camilla, ...that she was apparently doing some questionable work before working at city hall?
Camilla, What did you do again?
Dominic," Come on, stop it!"
Camilla," Men would call you to their hotel rooms so you could give them ""massages""?"
Camilla," Oh, you little whore."
Yor, That was...
Yor," ""Massages"" were a cover for occupational murders."
Yor," Um, please don't get the wrong idea, Loid. I—"
Loid, How wonderful.
Yor, Huh?
Loid, Yor lost her parents at a very young age.
Loid," She did all she could to care for her younger brother,"
Loid, even if it meant sacrificing herself.
Loid, Be it for someone else
Loid," or for a specific reason,having to endure a merciless job"
Loid, requires an incredible amount of dedication.
Loid, And that's something to be very proud of.
Loid," Let's go home, Yor."
Yor," Er, yes... Thank you for the lovely party, everyone."
Loid, I-I'm so sorry I said I was your husband.
Yor," Oh, it's all right."
Loid, I'm not sure what to tell your brother if he hears of this.
Yor," Um, Loid... I have a suggestion."
Loid, What...
Loid, Remnants of the smuggling ring?
Loid," Hang on, Yor!"
Yor, Huh?
Loid, How did they know where I was?
Loid, Did they... leave a tracking device in the art pieces?
Loid," You've definitely let your guard down, Twilight."
Yor, Who are those people?
Loid," Um, uh..."
Loid, I-It appears some of my patients still haven't recovered
Loid, from their psychotic episodes.
Yor, Being a doctor must be very taxing.
Loid, She actually believed it!
Loid, In the meantime...
Loid, We're making a break for it.
Remnant A, They've abandoned the van.
Remnant B, They're probably hiding nearby. Split up and find them.
Loid," Yor, this way. Hurry!"
Yor, Um... Are you sure it's all right for you to hit your patients like that?
Loid," Um, well..."
Loid, The concussive recovery method is the latest in modern medical practices.
Yor, I see.
Loid, I can't tell if she's actually bright or dumb.
Loid," Look out, Yor!"
Loid, Another one! I can't dodge it!
Yor," Oh, no!"
Yor, I'm so sorry an amateur like me helped with the recovery!
Yor, I happen to be an expert in self-defense.
Yor, My brother was kind enough to teach me...
Loid," Thank you, Yor."
Loid, That was quite impressive. Did you see how far he went?
Yor, I'm sorry. I guess I did send him flying.
Remnant G, There he is!
Loid, This way!
Remnant G, Do whatever you need to do! Make sure they're dead!
Yor," Um, Loid... This may not be the best moment to ask,"
Yor, but why don't we get married?
Loid, I'm sorry?!
Yor," Er, well, it would extend our agreement..."
Yor," I mean... Apparently, I'm considered suspicious just for being single,"
Yor, so it'd be nice camouflage...
Yor," For me to continue my job as an assassin, too."
Yor," Um, basically,"
Yor," if it's all right with you, maybe we could just stay together,"
Yor, and not just for the interview...
Yor, For both our sakes.
Yor, He's probably the only person who could accept me for who I am right now.
Loid, Then let's stop by city hall on our way back to fill out the paperwork.
Yor, Huh? Right now?!
Loid, They do say no time like the present.
Loid," Oh, that's right."
Loid, Where did I drop it?
Remnant B, You bastard!
Remnant B, We have 'em cornered!
Remnant A, Fill 'em full of lead!
Loid, Yor...
Loid," Even in sickness,"
Loid, or in sadness...
Loid," No matter what hardships await us,"
Loid, let us be there for one another.
Yor, All right.
Loid, Until my mission...
Yor, Until my k*lling...
Loid and Yor, ...do us part.
Narrator, Everyone has a side they don't show anyone else.
Narrator," To their friends, their significant others, or even their families."
Narrator," They hide what they're truly feeling through fake smiles or bravado,"
Narrator, and keep their true identities secret.
Narrator, That is how the world keeps up the appearance of its temporary peace.
Narrator, In an era in which the nations of the world were waging a fierce w*r
Narrator," of information just out of sight,"
Narrator, two countries were at odds with each other.
Narrator," Ostania, in the east, was secretly plotting to start a w*r."
Narrator," Westalis, in the west, wanted to put a stop to those plans."
Narrator," In order to keep an eye on the actions of a leading figure in Ostania's government,"
Narrator, Westalis set Operation Strix in motion.
Narrator," The one tasked with this operation is the skilled agent, Twilight."
Narrator, The mission given to the master of disguise with a hundred faces was...
Narrator, to start a family.
Loid, Is this everything you own?
Yor, Yes.
Loid, It's not very much.
Yor," Um, Loid... about the sleeping arrangements..."
Loid," We'll be sleeping in separate rooms, of course."
Loid, We'll share one for appearances anytime we have guests over.
Yor, R-Right.
Anya, Welcome to Anya's house!
Yor," Thank you for the lovely welcome, Miss Anya."
Narrator, This house is home to a rather unusual family.
Narrator," The father, Loid Forger, is a psychiatrist."
Narrator, His true identity: a spy.
Narrator, Code name: Twilight.
Narrator," The mother, Yor Forger, is a civil servant who works at city hall."
Narrator, Her true identity: an assassin.
Narrator, Code name: Thorn Princess.
Narrator," The daughter, Anya Forger."
Narrator, Her true identity: a telepath.
Anya, I'm so happy to have a mama now!
Yor, Mama...
Anya, I'm gonna help.
Loid," Oh, right. By the way..."
Loid, I had a friend of mine who's a judge make it so we got married a year ago.
Loid," By that, I mean he forged the certificate."
Loid, We can figure out why we lived separately and what to tell your brother later.
Yor, All right.
Loid, It would make the school suspicious if we got married just before the interview.
Yor," I got permission from the Shopkeeper, so I feel much better."
Anya, So exciting...
Narrator," Father, mother, daughter..."
Narrator," These three created this pretend family to further their own ends,"
Narrator, and are living under the same roof as they hide their true identities from each other.
Anya, I'm going to show Mama around!
Loid," Once we get settled in, we'll practice the interview."
Anya, This is the kitchen!
Anya, Papa is good at cooking!
Yor," Oh, I see."
Anya, This is the toilet. And that's the bathtub!
Yor, Everything's so clean.
Anya, I can wash my face all by myself!
Yor," You're such a big girl, Miss Anya."
Anya, This is Anya's room!
Anya, Welcome!
Yor, Thank you for inviting me in.
Yor," My, what an adorable room."
Anya, I'll introduce you to Mr. Chimera.
Anya, I am Chimera. It is a pweasure to meet your acquiantenance.
Yor," It's very nice to meet you, Mr. Chimera."
Yor, I am Miss Anya's mama.
Anya, This is Papa's room!
Yor, So this is Loid's room...
Anya," This is your room, Mama."
Anya," Come in, Mama."
Yor," Why, thank you."
Yor, So this is my...
Yor, What a lovely room.
Loid, I'm glad you like it.
Loid, This should be everything.
Loid, Is the furniture arranged to your liking? I also cleaned a bit.
Yor," Yes, everything is wonderful."
Anya," I helped clean, too!"
Yor, Really? Thank you so much.
Anya, Am I a good girl?
Loid, All you did was tip over a bucket of water.
Anya, Shock!
Yor, This is such a lovely room. I don't know what to do with myself.
Loid, What do you mean?
Loid, Please make yourself at home.
Loid," Actually, this is your home now, so make yourself comfortable."
Yor, Thank you.
Loid, I'll come get your boxes once they're empty.
Yor," Loid, I've got everything put away."
Loid, You're quite efficient.
Loid," Ah, this must be your younger brother."
Yor," Oh, yes."
Loid, You said he's also a civil servant?
Yor," Yes. He seems quite busy lately, so I've only spoken to him on the phone."
Loid, It seems you two are quite similar.
Loid, I should properly introduce myself once Anya's entrance exam is over.
Yor," Um, Loid. About that..."
Yor, I don't have anything suitable to wear to this interview...
Loid, Then let's go to the tailor today.
Yor, Thank you very much.
Anya," Helping, helping..."
Yor," M-Miss Anya, I'll take care of that!"
Yor, I have my work weapons and poison powerful enough to k*ll an elephant in there.
Yor," Can I get you something, Loid?"
Loid," Some coffee, please. Black."
Anya, I want hot cocoa!
Loid, With sugar and milk.
Anya, That's the stuff!
Yor, They look amazing. Are those cookies homemade?
Loid, It's actually my first time making cookies.
Loid," I just followed a recipe from a cookbook, so they should be decent."
Loid, I hope you like them.
Yor, Thank you.
Yor, They're wonderful! You really are an amazing cook!
Loid," It's not that impressive, really."
Anya," I helped with the cookies, too!"
Yor," Oh, I see."
Loid," After you got covered in flour and got in my way,"
Loid, you just snacked on some peanuts.
Loid," Once we're settled in, let's begin."
Loid, Eden College is one of the most prestigious schools in the country.
Loid," During the interview, not only will the child be evaluated,"
Loid, but so will the parents.
Loid, They will be evaluated on their social standing as well as how cultured they are.
Loid, Understood?
Loid," Now, let's start the questions."
Loid," First, please state your name and address."
Anya, Anya Fo...Fo...Horger. Address?
Loid, The place we're at right now.
Anya, This is Anya's house!
Loid, That's not what I meant.
Loid," Er, so, Miss Anya... How do you spend your days off?"
Anya," Papa orders me to stay home,"
Anya, so I have to watch TV all alone.
Loid," Now, wait a second."
Loid, That makes a terrible impression. Madam?
Yor, Yes?
Loid," Why did you choose Eden College, and how do you plan to pass this exam?"
Yor, How do people usually pass?
Yor," Um, pass, passing..."
Yor," Perhaps because of cardiac arrest, or excessive bleeding?"
Yor, Or compound fractures throughout the body?
Yor, Oh! Maybe their skull was caved in.
Loid, k*ll me now. Next question.
Loid, Could you describe your parenting methods?
Yor, Huh? U-Um... Strike first to be victorious?
Loid, I'm amazed her brother turned out to be a decent human being.
Loid, I've been a spy for over a decade.
Loid," I've completed countless missions,yet only now do I find myself losing heart."
Loid, This is pointless. There's no way we'll survive the interview at this rate.
Loid, Let's give up on getting her into that school.
Yor, Loid! Please remember your late wife's wishes!
Loid," Clearly, we weren't ready for this mock interview yet."
Loid," All right, let's go out for a bit."
Loid," Let's broaden our horizons, become versed in what is normal for an upper-class family,"
Loid, and make sure that we're all on the same page.
Anya," We're on an ooting, an ooting, la, la, la, lah!"
Loid," You mean ""outing."""
Anya," Wanna hold hands, Mama?"
Yor, I-If you don't mind.
Loid, Thank goodness Anya's taken a liking to her.
Loid, The plan is set.
Loid," After today, we'll seem like a normal... no."
Loid, We'll be seen as an upper-crust family.
Yor, Oh... This reminds me of when my little brother was still small and adorable.
Yor, And that one time I hugged him too hard and ended up breaking two of his ribs.
Yor, I must be careful.
Loid, Wait... what? Maybe not...
Yor," B-By the way, where are we headed?"
Loid, I've acquired a variety of tickets through my connections at work.
Loid, Tradition and status are everything at Eden College.
Loid," We'll have to experience and get accustomed to the best that life has to offer,"
Loid, and make sure we don't slip up if we let our guard down.
Loid," All right, next."
Loid," Anya, no yelling while we're here."
Anya, 'Kay.
Loid," We've experienced first-class music,"
Loid, so now for some first-class art... And you know the rest.
Anya, Papa! I can see her boobies!
Anya, Head's been choppy-chopped! Body's been choppy-chopped!
Loid, What did I just say about yelling?
Loid, Yor?
Loid, Y-Yor...?
Anya, I wanna do that!
Loid, Drawing? Sure.
Loid," Yor, why don't we sit down for a bit?"
Yor, All right.
Anya, Anya's house is a big castle.
Anya, The boss of the secret organization is Director Chimera.
Anya," Papa is a spy! Pew, pew!"
Anya," Mama is an assassin! Stabby, stabby, sploosh!"
Loid, We should probably get going.
Yor, Yes.
Anya, All done!
Loid," Anya, we're going to our next stop."
Anya," If Papa and Mama see this,they'll find out about my powers!"
Loid," Wow, that's quite a masterpiece."
Loid, There seems to be a pig in a forest.
Anya," That's Mr. Chimera, and he lives in a castle!"
Loid," I see. I definitely see Bondman there, though."
Loid," I'm right, aren't I?"
Anya, Yep...
Loid, It's that spy cartoon you were watching last week.
Loid, So this witch-looking one must be the princess.
Loid, That part seems rather graphic.
Loid," Oh, but that cat is cute."
Anya, That's a doggy!
Loid, I see. Then I apologize.
Loid, We're going to the tailor next.
Yor, Sorry to have you do this on your day off.
Loid, It's quite all right. This is something we need to do.
Anya, My going-out clothes are so cute!
Anya, They fit perfectly!
Anya, This shop is great! I love it!
Proprietress," Why, thank you."
Anya, This is my first ooting in my going-out clothes.
Proprietress, Then it must be a day of celebration.
Anya, A day to celebrate this ooting!
Loid," In that case, we can stop by a photography studio next."
Female Employee," Yor, dear. Right this way."
Yor, Coming.
Proprietress," If you're looking for a semi-formal dress, I think this color would do nicely."
Proprietress, What do you think?
Yor, I'd honestly prefer a black or red dress.
Proprietress," Really? I think this would look nice on you, Yor."
Proprietress, Then how about this?
Loid," Judging from her lack of luggage, I thought she had no interest in clothes."
Loid, I see you're particular about matching colors.
Yor, No... I wouldn't say that.
Yor," This color's lovely, but I'm worried that blood splatters would be too noticeable."
Female employee, Looks like Yor finally found someone nice.
Proprietress," Hopefully they last. Having a child already is an instant no for me, though."
Loid," Looks like the extra outfits will be ready by the interview, too."
Yor, I'm so sorry to have you get so many.
Loid," Well, you look nice in colors besides red and black."
Loid," We'll be going out more often, too."
Anya, Ootings! Ootings!
Loid," You're a regular at that shop, aren't you?"
Loid," I'm sure we'll continue to shop there, so next time, we should tell them we're married."
Yor," Oh, right."
Politician," We, the Nationalist Party, believe that there is a road to peace with the West."
Loid, Patriotism is also important within Eden.
Audience A, You moron!
Audience B, k*ll all the bastards in the West!
Politician, Continuing to treat Westalis as the enemy will do us no good.
Loid," I'll need to make sure she's knowledgeable of politics and history, as well."
Audience C," Piss off, traitor!"
Audience F," Gimme money, gimme money, gimme money..."
Audience D, Those bastards k*lled my family!
Audience E, Get lost with the pleasantries!
Audience G," First I lost my job, then my home!"
Loid, What's the matter?
Anya, I don't like places like this...
Audience H, k*ll all the shitheads in the West!
Loid, Sorry. Maybe this was a little scary for you.
Yor, Let's go rest somewhere.
Audience I, The East did nothing wrong!
Audience mob, Go back to your Western masters!
Audience mob, Damn it!
Audience mob, You pig!
Audience mob, You stupid baldy!
Audience mob," Your feet smell, too!"
Anya," Papa, I'm hungry."
Loid, Huh?
Loid, Are you all right or not?
Loid," No, Anya. Don't just pick the nuts off the and no eating with your hands."
Loid," And Yor, uh... Hmm..."
Loid, I've been a spy for over a decade.
Loid," I've completed countless missions,yet once again I find myself losing heart."
Anya," S'all good, Papa."
Loid, What is?
Loid," Yeah, I definitely picked the wrong child."
Loid," No, this is all because I was expected to rely on others."
Loid," I shouldn't have put the key to success in the hands of others, let alone civilians."
Loid," Predicting every possible situation, preparing for it,"
Loid, and acting from a carefully laid-out plan.
Loid, Those are the ironclad rules of being a spy.
Loid," Which means that I need to list every possible question the interviewer can ask,"
Loid, then have these two memorize the perfect answers to go with them.
Loid," If all else fails, make sure I can back them up—"
Yor, Um...
Yor, Why don't we go get some fresh air?
Anya, The people look like bits of trash from up here.
Loid, Where did you get that from?
Anya, My cartoons.
Loid, Ah...
Loid, I had no idea there was a park like this on the outskirts of town.
Yor," I don't come here that often either,"
Yor, but I wander over here when I'm exhausted from work.
Yor, Thinking about how the work I do helps everyone in this city out
Yor, encourages me to work harder.
Yor," Oh, this place must be awfully boring! I'm terribly sorry!"
Anya, I like this place better than crowded places!
Yor," Oh, that's wonderful!"
Old woman, Thief! Someone help!
Loid, That old lady should've been more careful.
Yor, You won't get away with this!
Yor, Hold it right there!
Loid," Oh, damn it."
Yor, I lost track of him.
Yor," Are you all right, ma'am? Are you hurt?"
Old woman, I'm fine. Just a few scratches.
Yor, I promise I'll catch him for you! And I'll take you to the hospital later!
Old woman," Why, thank you."
Yor, I left Loid and Anya behind.
Loid, He blended in with the crowd.
Loid," I'm very sorry, Yor, but you probably won't be able to find him now."
Mob A," Man, I'm starving."
Mob B, So expensive...
Mob C," Aw, this is so cute."
Mob D," Crap, I'm gonna piss my pants."
Mob E, My feet hurt.
Mob G, That shopworker is so cool.
Mob F, I wonder if there's a million dalc lying around somewhere.
Mob M," Oh, I forgot to pay my rent."
Mob H," Man, he's late."
Mob I," Honestly, this child..."
Mob J, What am I going to do? I failed my test again.
Mob K, That bastard. I'm gonna m*rder him.
Mob L, Maybe I'll say hi...
Loid," Hey, this again?"
Thief," Man, that old crone was loaded."
Anya, Papa!
Loid," Whoa, what?"
Anya, I wanna eat cake!
Loid, What?!
Loid, We just left the restaurant...
Loid, He's...
Loid," He changed his clothes, but it's not so easy to change the way you walk."
Loid, Don't think you'll get away from me.
Yor, Loid!
Anya, Mama's here.
Loid," Yor, look after Anya for me."
Thief, I'll be able to have plenty of fun for a while with this much.
Thief," First, I'm gonna treat myself to the finest meal and—"
Loid, A filthy swine like you deserves nothing more than the foulest meal.
Mob N, What's going on?
Mob O, A guy just dropped from the sky.
Loid, A spy must not bring attention to himself.
Mob P, Did he fall?
Loid," Pardon me. This fellow is a purse snatcher, so please call the police and hand him over."
Mob P, A purse snatcher?
Old woman, Thank you for escorting me all the way here.
Old woman, I had money to get my grandchild a gift in my purse.
Old woman, Thank you so much. You were a big help.
Yor," Oh, actually..."
Yor," The one who got it back was my, um, husband."
Loid," No, if you weren't there, Yor, I wouldn't have even gone after him."
Old woman, Thank you so much. What a fine gentleman you are.
Loid," Er, again..."
flashback Chief," Hero who casts no shadow,"
flashback Chief, the great deeds you and your fellow agents do shall never see the light of day.
Old woman, Thank you.
Loid, I guess... receiving thanks every once in a while wouldn't hurt.
Anya, Papa is a softie.
Loid," Thank you, Yor."
Loid, Today was a nice change of pace.
Loid, Now I'll be able to work hard again.
Anya, Papa and Mama are flirting.
Loid and Yor, We are not!
Anya," Does Anya get a thank you, too?"
Loid, Well... I guess we did find the thief because you were hungry again.
Loid, Good girl.
Old woman," My, what a lovely family you are."
Old woman," Here's some candy for you, dear."
Anya, Candy!
Loid," Make sure you say, ""Thank you."""
Anya, The ooting is over!
Loid, What a long day.
Anya, Mama!
Anya," I want some hot cocoa, please!"
Yor, As you wish.
Loid," Hey, more importantly, we need to retry this mock interview."
Loid," So, Miss Anya, how do you spend your days off?"
Anya," We go to the opera, the museum, and eat at restaurants."
Loid, Yes! Exactly!
Loid," If you're asked this question, make sure you talk about today."
Loid," Okay, next question."
Loid, You've seen your friend do something naughty.
Loid, What will you do?
Anya," I'd jump on top of them, b*at them up, and make them eat the foulest meal!"
Loid," Hmm... Pretend you never saw that, okay?"
Loid," Yup, this is hopeless. I'm done."
Anya," Papa, you were so cool!"
Yor," Yes, he was."
Anya, Ka-bam!
Anya, It's the foulest meal for you!
Anya, Hot cocoa is the best.
flashback Old woman," My, what a lovely family you are."
Loid, I guess if she saw us that way...
Loid, About one percent of my preparations are complete.
Loid, The time has come.
Loid, Let us check our personal effects.
Yor," All clear, sir."
Loid," And now, our appearances."
Yor," All clear, sir."
Loid, And a final check of our verbal etiquette.
Anya," All set, please. Will do my best, please."
Loid," I feel nothing but anxiety about this,"
Loid, but we've done everything we could.
Loid," Now, onward..."
Loid, To Eden College's interview!
Yor, It's so big!
Loid," Well, it is one of this country's top schools."
Yor, And there are so many examinees...
Loid, They're all our rivals.
Loid," Anya, are you going to be okay in this crowd?"
Anya," I'll be okay, please."
Loid," Let us go, then."
Loid, This feeling...
Loid, There's no doubt about it.
Loid, I've experienced this many times.
Loid, Someone is watching us. Could it be...
Loid, Is there an enemy hidden in this crowd?
Anya, An enemy?
Yor, I feel someone's gaze...
Loid," No, that's not it."
Loid, I'm not the only one being watched.
Loid, It's always an unpleasant feeling to be observed like this.
Loid, There.
Loid, Four in the overhead passage.
Loid, Four in the bell tower.
Loid, More in the buildings to the left and right.
Loid, I have information on most of the staff at this school.
Loid, Those... are the instructors.
Loid, They're observing every action that everyone is taking and scoring them
Loid, to see if they're worthy of this school.
Loid, Which means... the exam has already begun.
Loid, I need you two to be on your guard.
Loid, We're being watched by the examiners.
Yor, Huh?
Loid, We'll do this just as we practiced.
Instructor A," D-, fail."
Instructor B," A-, fail."
Instructor D," G-, pass."
Henderson," I must say, the examinees this year lack refinement."
Henderson, They all lack true elegance.
Teachers," Good morning, Housemaster."
Henderson, It displeases me to know their crude feet
Henderson, are trudging upon the blessed ground of our school.
Henderson, Elegance creates tradition.
Henderson, Elegance is what truly makes this world a paradise.
Henderson, Fail any family lacking elegance immediately.
Instructor B," Yes, sir."
Henderson, Hm?
Henderson, Oho...
Henderson, It appears that not all hope has been lost.
Henderson, They are paying their respects to the statue of our founder?!
Loid," I, Twilight, am a man of a thousand faces."
Loid, Becoming exactly the person my target wants me to be is mere child's play.
Loid, Behold!
Yor," I haven't the slightest clue as to who this gentleman is,"
Yor, but everything should be fine as long as I do what Loid is doing.
Anya, Baldy head!
Henderson, S-So elegant!
Henderson, How very elegant!
Henderson, Who is that family?
Instructor D," K-. They are the Forgers, sir."
Instructor D, Their daughter Anya just barely passed the written exam with a score of .
Henderson, Absolutely not elegant! And such awful penmanship!
Henderson, So the father has remarried?
Instructor B, Might they be an impromptu family for admission purposes?
Henderson, I am not certain. We must investigate.
Henderson, We must ascertain whether or not they have true elegance.
Instructor E, We'll confirm your admission numbers here.
Instructor F, G-. Please go to Hall .
Instructor F," Ah, A-. Please enter Hall ."
Loid, I see they're wasting no time with the screening.
Instructor F, K-. Please head to Hall .
Loid, We're still being observed. Don't let your guard down.
Yor, It's so nerve-racking being watched like this...
Anya, I need to pick my nose.
Loid, Absolutely not.
Boy," Oh, no!"
Boy," I've accidentally fallen into the gutter, and I can't get out!"
Loid, Uh... That's too blatant if they're trying to test us.
Boy," Oh, no. Whatever shall I do?"
Loid," Perhaps they're thinking he might be a thr*at,"
Boy," Ah, I don't know what I should do."
Loid, but no one is trying to go near him.
Boy, Who knew there'd be a gutter here?
Loid," But if he is part of the test, we must deal with this accordingly."
Boy, I'm so shocked. I'm really stuck.
Anya," Papa! Mama! There is someone who needs our help, please!"
Anya, Let us save him!
Loid," Are you all right, lad?"
Boy," Oh, no! I've slipped and I cannot get up!"
Boy Internal, This is all for merits... More merits!
Henderson, Precisely.
Henderson, You're heading to an interview. You wouldn't dare sully your clothes with sewage.
Henderson," Now, how will you elegantly get through—"
Loid, Are you hurt?
Anya," Use my hanky, please."
Loid," Make sure you go to the infirmary, just in case."
Henderson," Clearly, I expected too much."
Henderson," In the end, they were just some commoners from the countryside."
Henderson, Do not think for a second that you can
Henderson, set foot in our house of learning wearing soiled clothes.
Henderson, Throw K- out immediately.
Boy," Oh, no... These people are going to fail because of me."
Boy," Um, I'm so sorr—"
Yor," Thank goodness we anticipated this,"
Yor, and prepared a change of clothes just in case!
Henderson, Who in the world would ever anticipate that?!
Yor," Besides, your grey suit seems to fit the attire at this school more."
Loid," If I had continued wearing my previous suit,"
Loid, we would've been mistaken for commoners from the countryside.
Loid," Thank you for giving us the opportunity to change, lad."
Henderson," On top of everything else, they even thanked the boy!"
Henderson," Brilliant... So smart, and elegant!"
Henderson," Curse you and your cunning, Loid Forger."
Instructor B," Housemaster, we are supposed to be testing the child."
Henderson, Silence!
Henderson, Children learn from their parents' example!
Henderson, Yes. The parents of a child who scores points must also be only worth points!
Henderson, I'll make you reveal your true identity yet!
Man," Oh, no!"
Man, The animals have escaped the farmhouse!
Loid," You're really going this far, Eden College?!"
Mob ," Hey, don't push me!"
Mob ," Just go, you moron!"
Mob ," Mommy! Mommy, Mommy!"
Mob , Shut up!
Loid, Are they trying to see if we reveal our true selves in an emergency?
Loid, We'll be playing right into the examiners' hands if we panic.
Loid, Do not break Formation D.
Loid, We will show these animals nothing but benevolence!
Henderson, Hey.
Henderson, Who told you to go that far?
Instructor D, Wait...
Instructor D," It wasn't you, Housemaster?"
Henderson, Impossible! Is this...
Henderson, an actual accident?!
Henderson, There are some very important people among the examinees!
Henderson, Go stop this mess before they're hurt!
Vice Minister, I'm the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance!
Banker, Hell if I care! I'm the CEO of the Central Bank!
Child A, Wait! Father!
Vice Minister," Well done, you!"
Loid, Are you all right?
Yor, Loid!
Yor, It's happening to Miss Anya again.
Loid, The mass panic must've hit her.
Loid, The test is the last thing I need to worry about now.
Loid, That must be the leader of this herd.
Loid, That's the one I need to s but I'll have to use my g*n—
Loid, No...
Yor, Please look after Miss Anya for a moment.
Loid, Yor?
Yor, I-It's not what you think!
Yor, I once learned about pressure points that can stop one's movements in a yoga class!
Yor," I-I figured they might work on cows, too!"
Yor, Please don't look at me like that!
Anya, Ms. Cow?
Anya, Is she scared?
Loid," That's dangerous, Anya!"
Anya," S'okay, please. Don't be scared."
Loid, What are you—
Anya, They're gonna go home now.
Loid, Apparently so.
Loid," Thankfully, no one was hurt."
Henderson, E-Ele...
Henderson, Ele-le... Ele-le-le-le...
Henderson, Elegance!
Instructor B, Housemaster?
Henderson, Forger!
Loid, He's...
Loid, one of the housemasters.
Loid, Is he in charge of this exam?
Henderson, Y-You helped us avoid a crisis. I thank you.
Henderson, And... you have bested me for today.
Henderson," To give us all time to collect ourselves after this chaos,"
Henderson, we will be delaying the start of the interviews.
Henderson, Return to your hall once you've had a moment to tidy yourselves.
Henderson, Your family has the right to apply to our school.
Loid, Sir...
Loid, It looks like we've avoided failure.
Loid, I humbly thank you for your generosity.
Loid, But have no fear.
Loid, We anticipated something like this...
Loid, and prepared another change of clothes.
Henderson, This isn't about elegance anymore! These people are just scary!
Narrator, The Forgers successfully make it to the actual interview.
Swan, You truly thought you could apply to our school without even knowing that?
Child B, Huh?
Swan, Well? Cat got your tongue?
Child B, Huh?
Child B," Um, uh..."
Father D, Thank you very much.
Father D, What kind of answer was that?!
Loid," I've been a spy for over a decade,"
Loid, and for the first time...
Loid, I'm actually nervous.
Loid," Even when I infiltrated the ranks of an evil t*rror1st group,"
Loid, or when I managed to stop the launch of a m*ssile with one second remaining...
Loid, I never found it so hard to breathe as I do right now.
Loid, The fear of letting someone else decide my success or failure...
Instructor G," Next, the Forgers."
Anya, Yep!
Loid and Yor," Yes, sir."
Loid," Yes, this is definitely going to be..."
Loid, the most crucial moment of Operation Strix!
Evans," Please, have a seat."
Loid, Thank you for having us.
Henderson," So you've come, Forgers."
Loid, The Forgers shall prevail in this game of information warfare.
Evans," First, we will begin by asking the parents a few questions."
Walter Evans Housemaster of Dorm Subject Taught, English Personality: Mild-mannered • Sincere • Conservative
Loid," The housemaster of Dorm , Malcom Hall."
Loid," Mild-mannered, sincere, and conservative."
Loid, The students are very fond of him.
Loid," As long as we respond with sincere, logical answers,"
Loid, we'll score highly with him.
Evans, I was informed that this is your second wife. May I ask how you two met?
Loid, I see we're getting straight to the point.
Loid," Eden College does prioritize family values, after all."
Loid," I met my wife at the tailor shop that handles this school's uniforms,"
Loid, and I was in awe of her grace.
Loid," Ever since I lost my first wife,"
Loid, I was hesitant to pursue another relationship because of my daughter.
Loid," But the more we spoke, the more I felt that she was a kindred spirit."
Loid, She is truly kind and cares dearly about family.
Loid, I came to the conclusion that she'd get along well with my daughter.
Evans," Ah... And what about you, Madam?"
Yor, Well...
Yor, L-Loid is a wonderful person who truly cares for his daughter.
Yor, He's also very considerate of me.
Evans," Ah, I'm happy to hear that you have such a loving family."
Swan, Why would a beautiful girl like you choose to be with a man who's got baggage?
Henderson," That was rather uncouth, Master Swan."
 Subject Taught, Economics Personality: Arrogant • Greedy • Callous
Loid," The housemaster of Dorm , Cline Hall."
Loid," He's the only son of the former headmaster, and a legacy hire."
Loid," Arrogant, greedy, and callous."
Loid," His wife filed for divorce last month,"
Loid," and he just lost custody of his daughter, as well."
Loid," Reviewing all of his previous interview questions and comments,"
Loid," he is clearly jealous of other families, and takes out his frustrations on them."
Loid, It's best that we avoid provoking him.
Evans, Now for our next question.
Evans, Could you tell us why you chose to apply to our school?
Loid," For only one reason, sir."
Loid Internal," To get close to my target, Desmond!"
Loid, The quality of the instructors at this establishment is superior.
Loid," Of course, you are all very knowledgeable and cultured,"
Loid," but when it comes to teaching anything, from patriotism to how to be an elite,"
Loid, the instructors of the prestigious Eden College
Loid, are second to none.
 Subject Taught, History Personality: Elegant
Henderson," Elegantly done, Loid Forger."
Henderson, I knew I saw potential in you.
Evans," Now then, how would the two of you describe your daughter?"
Evans, Please let us know about her strengths and weaknesses.
Loid, Anya is an extremely curious child.
Loid," Her habit of sticking her nose where it doesn't belong could be seen as a weakness,"
Loid, but she is a truly intelligent child.
Henderson, Intelligent?! Her?!
Anya, Shock!
Loid," Sometimes, it's like she sees right through me,"
Anya, Yikes...
Loid, which keeps me on my feet.
Loid, I would say her main shortcoming is that she's a picky eater.
Evan," Ah... And how would you describe your parenting style, Madam?"
Yor, Just like we practiced...
Yor," As you already know, I am not her biological mother."
Yor," At first, I spoiled her quite often in hopes that she would like me."
Yor," But for the sake of her future, I'm hoping I can become a bit stricter at times."
Evans, We've been told that your daughter is a picky eater.
Evans, What kind of meals do you cook at home?
Yor, Huh? C-Cook?
Yor, Um...
Loid, I actually do most of the cooking.
Loid," Though when I'm busy, my wife is kind enough to cook for me."
Loid, Not that that's happened even once yet.
Swan, You're joking! What kind of wife can't cook for her husband?!
Swan, You should probably be stricter with yourself before you worry about that child.
Loid, Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
Loid, She is extremely tidy and excels at keeping our house spotless.
Loid, She is also an excellent mother to my daughter.
Swan," Yes, well, both of those are things women are expected to do."
Loid, That's—
Yor," I-It's all right, Loid."
Evans," Now, now..."
Loid, Yes. Calm down.
Loid," Why are you getting irritated, Twilight?"
Loid, She's not even your real wife.
Swan, A lovey-dovey hot couple? You make me sick.
Swan, I'll keep jabbing at you until you slip up.
Swan," If I can't make sure these two fail, there's clearly no justice in this world."
Anya, He doesn't like Papa and Mama!
Anya, I need to do my best!
Evans," N-Next, let's ask the young lady some questions."
Loid, Here it comes.
Evans," First, could you tell us your name and address?"
Anya, My name is Anya Holger!
Anya," My address is in... Berlint, West District..."
Anya, Park... Avenue!
Evans," And what do you do on your days off, young lady?"
Anya, We go to moozeums...
Anya, and eat operas...
Loid, Good. These were questions we anticipated.
Evans, What would you like to do once you get into this school?
Anya," Um, uh..."
Anya, What was I supposed to say?
Loid," In my case, I first need to participate in a social gathering,"
Loid," and get to the bottom of what the boss of the enemy organization, Desmond, is planning."
Anya, I-I want to find out what the boss of the organization is planning!
Loid, What in the world are you saying?! Hello?!
Evans, The boss of the organization? Maybe you meant the headmaster.
Loid, I do apologize. My daughter is rather ambitious.
Loid," She's extremely curious about the headmaster, since he's clearly made it to the top."
Henderson, Oho...
Henderson, The desire to learn from her predecessors at such an early age...
Henderson, That's quite elegant.
Henderson," Do you happen to know the name of the principal, young lady?"
Anya," Um, B-Be..."
Loid, Yes. Benedict Ivan Goodfellow.
Anya, Mr. Benedick Advent Goodheller.
Henderson," Hmm... Then,"
Henderson, could you tell us how hard you would have to work in order to succeed like him?
Anya," Yes. Like getting through the jungle with no supplies,"
Anya, and dancing with death over and over to get brave!
Loid, That was the training montage the protagonist of her spy cartoon did yesterday.
Henderson, S-Such incredible resolve!
Henderson, It appears as though I have underestimated this young lady.
Evans, I don't think you have to do quite that much.
Evans, Let's change the subject. What does your father do for a living?
Anya, He's a sp—a speshulist in mental health. A very good one.
Evans, Hm? Are you a little stuffed up?
Evans, Then how do you feel about your new mother?
Anya, She is very nice.
Anya, But she's scary sometimes.
Evans," If you were to give your parents a score, what might that be?"
Anya, A perfect points.
Anya," My Papa and Mama are both so much fun, and I love them very much."
Anya, I want to be with them forever.
Swan," Tch. God, no one needs this rubbish."
Swan," In that case, would you score your old mother or your new mother higher?"
Evans," Come now, Master Swan..."
Swan, Is there a problem?
Loid, May I respectfully request a different question?
Swan," Absolutely not. If you do not answer, you will lose points."
Loid," I don't know exactly how she ended up in that orphanage,"
Loid, but her actual parents are probably already...
Anya, Ma...ma...
Loid, Anya...
Anya, Mama...
Swan," I see, I see."
Swan, So you do prefer your old mother.
Yor, This is too cruel!
Loid," Please calm down, Yor."
Yor, But this is just—
Loid, We need to remain calm for the sake of this mission.
Swan, We have plenty of students here who live away from their parents in our dorms.
Swan," If she's going to cry over every little trifling thing,"
Swan, she'll never survive at our establishment!
Loid, So what if he's being slanderous?
Loid, We are nothing more than a pretend family.
Yor, Trifling? You call this trifling?
Loid, This is nothing.
Swan," Now, now, Mrs. Second Wife."
Swan, Don't snap at me just because she loves her real mother more.
Swan," Oh, I feel so much better."
Loid, Restrain yourself...
Loid, Twilight!
Loid, I do beg your pardon.
Loid, There was a mosquito.
Loid, Thank you very much for your time today.
Swan," Hey, where are you going?!"
Swan, The interview's not over yet!
Loid," If making light of a child's feelings is part of your establishment's educational policies,"
Loid, then I'm afraid we have chosen the wrong school.
Swan, You fiend! You dare disgrace our fine school?!
Loid," Come now, you two."
Loid, Please excuse us.
Swan, Don't think you'll ever walk through our gates again!
Henderson," That's quite enough, Master Swan."
Swan, Are you taking issue with my methods?
Swan," He may be the former headmaster,"
Evans," Now, now..."
Swan, but my father's influence within this school is still strong.
Swan, It'd be wise for you to watch that mouth of yours.
Swan, Hey! Hurry up and call the next one in!
Loid, ...the instructors of the prestigious Eden College
flashback Loid, are second to none.
Henderson," If all I can do is curry favor with the authorities,"
Henderson, I have no right to call myself an educator.
Henderson," I must ask, who truly disgraced our school?"
Swan, Huh?!
Evans, Wha—
Henderson, Hmm...
Henderson," That was rather elegant, if I do say so myself."
Henderson," Now, will you be able to face the instructors at Eden head-on,"
Henderson, Forgers?
Loid, Yeah... We definitely failed.
Yor, I-I'll go make us some tea.
Loid, I've failed yet again as a spy.
Loid, I let unnecessary feelings get in the way of the mission.
Anya, Papa...
Anya, I'm sorry.
Anya, I'm so sorry that I couldn't do better
Anya, on my tests.
Loid," It's all right, Anya. You have no reason to apologize."
Loid," You don't want to go to a school like that, do you?"
Anya, But I want to go to school...
Loid, Huh?
Anya Internal, If this mission fails...
Anya, I have to go to school or...
Anya Internal, ...we won't be together anymore.
Loid, Anya...
Yor," If she fails, of course, our life here together will be..."
Yor, But that doesn't matter.
Yor, I'm just worried how this may affect my work.
Loid," Hmm... But to be honest,"
Loid, Hell will freeze over before you pass.
Anya, Shock!
Yor, I-I'm sure everything will be okay!
Yor, It'll all work out!
Anya, The grandpa with the glasses and the grandpa with the half-glasses
Anya, were really nice!
Yor," Yes, exactly!"
Yor, I'm sure they'll vouch for us! Let's believe in them.
Loid, Spies don't believe in anyone other than themselves.
Loid, They always expect the worst-case scenarios and prepare for them.
Anya, I want to be with them forever.
Loid, But... Maybe just a little bit...
Loid," Yes. Let's leave the result to fate,"
Loid, and try to recover from how exhausting that exam was.
Loid," Right now, just for a little bit..."
Loid, To our family's bright future!
Anya, Something just fell!
Yor, Our family portrait fell to the floor.
Loid, It just fell...
Narrator, What will become
Narrator, of their mission?
Loid, The time has come.
Loid, Let us check our personal effects.
Yor," All clear, sir."
Loid," And now, our appearances."
Yor," All clear, sir."
Loid, And a final check of our verbal etiquette.
Anya," All set, please. Will do my best, please."
Loid," I feel nothing but anxiety about this,"
Loid, but we've done everything we could.
Loid," Now, onward..."
Loid, To Eden College's interview!
Yor, It's so big!
Loid," Well, it is one of this country's top schools."
Yor, And there are so many examinees...
Loid, They're all our rivals.
Loid," Anya, are you going to be okay in this crowd?"
Anya," I'll be okay, please."
Loid," Let us go, then."
Loid, This feeling...
Loid, There's no doubt about it.
Loid, I've experienced this many times.
Loid, Someone is watching us. Could it be...
Loid, Is there an enemy hidden in this crowd?
Anya, An enemy?
Yor, I feel someone's gaze...
Loid," No, that's not it."
Loid, I'm not the only one being watched.
Loid, It's always an unpleasant feeling to be observed like this.
Loid, There.
Loid, Four in the overhead passage.
Loid, Four in the bell tower.
Loid, More in the buildings to the left and right.
Loid, I have information on most of the staff at this school.
Loid, Those... are the instructors.
Loid, They're observing every action that everyone is taking and scoring them
Loid, to see if they're worthy of this school.
Loid, Which means... the exam has already begun.
Loid, I need you two to be on your guard.
Loid, We're being watched by the examiners.
Yor, Huh?
Loid, We'll do this just as we practiced.
Instructor A," D-, fail."
Instructor B," A-, fail."
Instructor D," G-, pass."
Henderson," I must say, the examinees this year lack refinement."
Henderson, They all lack true elegance.
Teachers," Good morning, Housemaster."
Henderson, It displeases me to know their crude feet
Henderson, are trudging upon the blessed ground of our school.
Henderson, Elegance creates tradition.
Henderson, Elegance is what truly makes this world a paradise.
Henderson, Fail any family lacking elegance immediately.
Instructor B," Yes, sir."
Henderson, Hm?
Henderson, Oho...
Henderson, It appears that not all hope has been lost.
Henderson, They are paying their respects to the statue of our founder?!
Loid," I, Twilight, am a man of a thousand faces."
Loid, Becoming exactly the person my target wants me to be is mere child's play.
Loid, Behold!
Yor," I haven't the slightest clue as to who this gentleman is,"
Yor, but everything should be fine as long as I do what Loid is doing.
Anya, Baldy head!
Henderson, S-So elegant!
Henderson, How very elegant!
Henderson, Who is that family?
Instructor D," K-. They are the Forgers, sir."
Instructor D, Their daughter Anya just barely passed the written exam with a score of .
Henderson, Absolutely not elegant! And such awful penmanship!
Henderson, So the father has remarried?
Instructor B, Might they be an impromptu family for admission purposes?
Henderson, I am not certain. We must investigate.
Henderson, We must ascertain whether or not they have true elegance.
Instructor E, We'll confirm your admission numbers here.
Instructor F, G-. Please go to Hall .
Instructor F," Ah, A-. Please enter Hall ."
Loid, I see they're wasting no time with the screening.
Instructor F, K-. Please head to Hall .
Loid, We're still being observed. Don't let your guard down.
Yor, It's so nerve-racking being watched like this...
Anya, I need to pick my nose.
Loid, Absolutely not.
Boy," Oh, no!"
Boy," I've accidentally fallen into the gutter, and I can't get out!"
Loid, Uh... That's too blatant if they're trying to test us.
Boy," Oh, no. Whatever shall I do?"
Loid," Perhaps they're thinking he might be a thr*at,"
Boy," Ah, I don't know what I should do."
Loid, but no one is trying to go near him.
Boy, Who knew there'd be a gutter here?
Loid," But if he is part of the test, we must deal with this accordingly."
Boy, I'm so shocked. I'm really stuck.
Anya," Papa! Mama! There is someone who needs our help, please!"
Anya, Let us save him!
Loid," Are you all right, lad?"
Boy," Oh, no! I've slipped and I cannot get up!"
Boy Internal, This is all for merits... More merits!
Henderson, Precisely.
Henderson, You're heading to an interview. You wouldn't dare sully your clothes with sewage.
Henderson," Now, how will you elegantly get through—"
Loid, Are you hurt?
Anya," Use my hanky, please."
Loid," Make sure you go to the infirmary, just in case."
Henderson," Clearly, I expected too much."
Henderson," In the end, they were just some commoners from the countryside."
Henderson, Do not think for a second that you can
Henderson, set foot in our house of learning wearing soiled clothes.
Henderson, Throw K- out immediately.
Boy," Oh, no... These people are going to fail because of me."
Boy," Um, I'm so sorr—"
Yor," Thank goodness we anticipated this,"
Yor, and prepared a change of clothes just in case!
Henderson, Who in the world would ever anticipate that?!
Yor," Besides, your grey suit seems to fit the attire at this school more."
Loid," If I had continued wearing my previous suit,"
Loid, we would've been mistaken for commoners from the countryside.
Loid," Thank you for giving us the opportunity to change, lad."
Henderson," On top of everything else, they even thanked the boy!"
Henderson," Brilliant... So smart, and elegant!"
Henderson," Curse you and your cunning, Loid Forger."
Instructor B," Housemaster, we are supposed to be testing the child."
Henderson, Silence!
Henderson, Children learn from their parents' example!
Henderson, Yes. The parents of a child who scores points must also be only worth points!
Henderson, I'll make you reveal your true identity yet!
Man," Oh, no!"
Man, The animals have escaped the farmhouse!
Loid," You're really going this far, Eden College?!"
Mob ," Hey, don't push me!"
Mob ," Just go, you moron!"
Mob ," Mommy! Mommy, Mommy!"
Mob , Shut up!
Loid, Are they trying to see if we reveal our true selves in an emergency?
Loid, We'll be playing right into the examiners' hands if we panic.
Loid, Do not break Formation D.
Loid, We will show these animals nothing but benevolence!
Henderson, Hey.
Henderson, Who told you to go that far?
Instructor D, Wait...
Instructor D," It wasn't you, Housemaster?"
Henderson, Impossible! Is this...
Henderson, an actual accident?!
Henderson, There are some very important people among the examinees!
Henderson, Go stop this mess before they're hurt!
Vice Minister, I'm the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance!
Banker, Hell if I care! I'm the CEO of the Central Bank!
Child A, Wait! Father!
Vice Minister," Well done, you!"
Loid, Are you all right?
Yor, Loid!
Yor, It's happening to Miss Anya again.
Loid, The mass panic must've hit her.
Loid, The test is the last thing I need to worry about now.
Loid, That must be the leader of this herd.
Loid, That's the one I need to s but I'll have to use my g*n—
Loid, No...
Yor, Please look after Miss Anya for a moment.
Loid, Yor?
Yor, I-It's not what you think!
Yor, I once learned about pressure points that can stop one's movements in a yoga class!
Yor," I-I figured they might work on cows, too!"
Yor, Please don't look at me like that!
Anya, Ms. Cow?
Anya, Is she scared?
Loid," That's dangerous, Anya!"
Anya," S'okay, please. Don't be scared."
Loid, What are you—
Anya, They're gonna go home now.
Loid, Apparently so.
Loid," Thankfully, no one was hurt."
Henderson, E-Ele...
Henderson, Ele-le... Ele-le-le-le...
Henderson, Elegance!
Instructor B, Housemaster?
Henderson, Forger!
Loid, He's...
Loid, one of the housemasters.
Loid, Is he in charge of this exam?
Henderson, Y-You helped us avoid a crisis. I thank you.
Henderson, And... you have bested me for today.
Henderson," To give us all time to collect ourselves after this chaos,"
Henderson, we will be delaying the start of the interviews.
Henderson, Return to your hall once you've had a moment to tidy yourselves.
Henderson, Your family has the right to apply to our school.
Loid, Sir...
Loid, It looks like we've avoided failure.
Loid, I humbly thank you for your generosity.
Loid, But have no fear.
Loid, We anticipated something like this...
Loid, and prepared another change of clothes.
Henderson, This isn't about elegance anymore! These people are just scary!
Narrator, The Forgers successfully make it to the actual interview.
Swan, You truly thought you could apply to our school without even knowing that?
Child B, Huh?
Swan, Well? Cat got your tongue?
Child B, Huh?
Child B," Um, uh..."
Father D, Thank you very much.
Father D, What kind of answer was that?!
Loid," I've been a spy for over a decade,"
Loid, and for the first time...
Loid, I'm actually nervous.
Loid," Even when I infiltrated the ranks of an evil t*rror1st group,"
Loid, or when I managed to stop the launch of a m*ssile with one second remaining...
Loid, I never found it so hard to breathe as I do right now.
Loid, The fear of letting someone else decide my success or failure...
Instructor G," Next, the Forgers."
Anya, Yep!
Loid and Yor," Yes, sir."
Loid," Yes, this is definitely going to be..."
Loid, the most crucial moment of Operation Strix!
Evans," Please, have a seat."
Loid, Thank you for having us.
Henderson," So you've come, Forgers."
Loid, The Forgers shall prevail in this game of information warfare.
Evans," First, we will begin by asking the parents a few questions."
Walter Evans Housemaster of Dorm Subject Taught, English Personality: Mild-mannered • Sincere • Conservative
Loid," The housemaster of Dorm , Malcom Hall."
Loid," Mild-mannered, sincere, and conservative."
Loid, The students are very fond of him.
Loid," As long as we respond with sincere, logical answers,"
Loid, we'll score highly with him.
Evans, I was informed that this is your second wife. May I ask how you two met?
Loid, I see we're getting straight to the point.
Loid," Eden College does prioritize family values, after all."
Loid," I met my wife at the tailor shop that handles this school's uniforms,"
Loid, and I was in awe of her grace.
Loid," Ever since I lost my first wife,"
Loid, I was hesitant to pursue another relationship because of my daughter.
Loid," But the more we spoke, the more I felt that she was a kindred spirit."
Loid, She is truly kind and cares dearly about family.
Loid, I came to the conclusion that she'd get along well with my daughter.
Evans," Ah... And what about you, Madam?"
Yor, Well...
Yor, L-Loid is a wonderful person who truly cares for his daughter.
Yor, He's also very considerate of me.
Evans," Ah, I'm happy to hear that you have such a loving family."
Swan, Why would a beautiful girl like you choose to be with a man who's got baggage?
Henderson," That was rather uncouth, Master Swan."
 Subject Taught, Economics Personality: Arrogant • Greedy • Callous
Loid," The housemaster of Dorm , Cline Hall."
Loid," He's the only son of the former headmaster, and a legacy hire."
Loid," Arrogant, greedy, and callous."
Loid," His wife filed for divorce last month,"
Loid," and he just lost custody of his daughter, as well."
Loid," Reviewing all of his previous interview questions and comments,"
Loid," he is clearly jealous of other families, and takes out his frustrations on them."
Loid, It's best that we avoid provoking him.
Evans, Now for our next question.
Evans, Could you tell us why you chose to apply to our school?
Loid," For only one reason, sir."
Loid Internal," To get close to my target, Desmond!"
Loid, The quality of the instructors at this establishment is superior.
Loid," Of course, you are all very knowledgeable and cultured,"
Loid," but when it comes to teaching anything, from patriotism to how to be an elite,"
Loid, the instructors of the prestigious Eden College
Loid, are second to none.
 Subject Taught, History Personality: Elegant
Henderson," Elegantly done, Loid Forger."
Henderson, I knew I saw potential in you.
Evans," Now then, how would the two of you describe your daughter?"
Evans, Please let us know about her strengths and weaknesses.
Loid, Anya is an extremely curious child.
Loid," Her habit of sticking her nose where it doesn't belong could be seen as a weakness,"
Loid, but she is a truly intelligent child.
Henderson, Intelligent?! Her?!
Anya, Shock!
Loid," Sometimes, it's like she sees right through me,"
Anya, Yikes...
Loid, which keeps me on my feet.
Loid, I would say her main shortcoming is that she's a picky eater.
Evan," Ah... And how would you describe your parenting style, Madam?"
Yor, Just like we practiced...
Yor," As you already know, I am not her biological mother."
Yor," At first, I spoiled her quite often in hopes that she would like me."
Yor," But for the sake of her future, I'm hoping I can become a bit stricter at times."
Evans, We've been told that your daughter is a picky eater.
Evans, What kind of meals do you cook at home?
Yor, Huh? C-Cook?
Yor, Um...
Loid, I actually do most of the cooking.
Loid," Though when I'm busy, my wife is kind enough to cook for me."
Loid, Not that that's happened even once yet.
Swan, You're joking! What kind of wife can't cook for her husband?!
Swan, You should probably be stricter with yourself before you worry about that child.
Loid, Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
Loid, She is extremely tidy and excels at keeping our house spotless.
Loid, She is also an excellent mother to my daughter.
Swan," Yes, well, both of those are things women are expected to do."
Loid, That's—
Yor," I-It's all right, Loid."
Evans," Now, now..."
Loid, Yes. Calm down.
Loid," Why are you getting irritated, Twilight?"
Loid, She's not even your real wife.
Swan, A lovey-dovey hot couple? You make me sick.
Swan, I'll keep jabbing at you until you slip up.
Swan," If I can't make sure these two fail, there's clearly no justice in this world."
Anya, He doesn't like Papa and Mama!
Anya, I need to do my best!
Evans," N-Next, let's ask the young lady some questions."
Loid, Here it comes.
Evans," First, could you tell us your name and address?"
Anya, My name is Anya Holger!
Anya," My address is in... Berlint, West District..."
Anya, Park... Avenue!
Evans," And what do you do on your days off, young lady?"
Anya, We go to moozeums...
Anya, and eat operas...
Loid, Good. These were questions we anticipated.
Evans, What would you like to do once you get into this school?
Anya," Um, uh..."
Anya, What was I supposed to say?
Loid," In my case, I first need to participate in a social gathering,"
Loid," and get to the bottom of what the boss of the enemy organization, Desmond, is planning."
Anya, I-I want to find out what the boss of the organization is planning!
Loid, What in the world are you saying?! Hello?!
Evans, The boss of the organization? Maybe you meant the headmaster.
Loid, I do apologize. My daughter is rather ambitious.
Loid," She's extremely curious about the headmaster, since he's clearly made it to the top."
Henderson, Oho...
Henderson, The desire to learn from her predecessors at such an early age...
Henderson, That's quite elegant.
Henderson," Do you happen to know the name of the principal, young lady?"
Anya," Um, B-Be..."
Loid, Yes. Benedict Ivan Goodfellow.
Anya, Mr. Benedick Advent Goodheller.
Henderson," Hmm... Then,"
Henderson, could you tell us how hard you would have to work in order to succeed like him?
Anya," Yes. Like getting through the jungle with no supplies,"
Anya, and dancing with death over and over to get brave!
Loid, That was the training montage the protagonist of her spy cartoon did yesterday.
Henderson, S-Such incredible resolve!
Henderson, It appears as though I have underestimated this young lady.
Evans, I don't think you have to do quite that much.
Evans, Let's change the subject. What does your father do for a living?

Narrator, What will become
Narrator, of their mission?
Female Member, Today is the day.
Chief, Hm? For what?
Female Member, You have to ask?
Female member, It's the day Eden College announces the admissions results.
Female Member, The results should be posted at hours today.
Loid, This is more nerve-racking than I thought it'd be.
Yor, My bracelet just broke. Why did it have to happen today?
Loid," Oh, I'm sure it's just a coincidence."
Yor," L-Loid, look."
Loid," Oh, come on, Yor. Black cats being unlucky is just a superstition."
Yor, Y-You're right.
Anya, Papa...
Loid, What's the matter?
Anya, I just stepped in poop.
Chief, Admissions results for Eden College?
Chief," Ah, the thing we've got Agent Twilight doing."
Female Member," Chief, peace between the East and West hangs on Operation Strix."
Female Member, Please take this more seriously.
Chief," You don't know Twilight very well, do you?"
Female Member," C-Correct, sir."
Caption, Underwear:
Chief," He might just be the best spy in all of Westalis, so don't worry so much."
Chief," He'll be telling us that ""the sakura blossoms bloom"" soon enough."
Female Member," What does that mean, sir?"
Chief, It's a code phrase from the Far East.
Chief, It means they passed.
Loid, It's not there.
Sign, WILL THEY PASS OR FAIL?
Yor, We failed...
Loid, We failed...
Anya, We failed.
Loid, L-Let's head home.
Yor, I-I'll make us some tea.
Anya, I'm sorry... It's all because I stepped in poop.
Henderson," A moment, Forgers."
Loid, Master Henderson...
Loid, What is this?
Henderson, Look at the very top.
Loid, Anya Forger...
Henderson," That is the waiting list of successful applicants, though rather confidential."
Loid, A waiting list?
Henderson," Correct. Once her overall scores were tallied,"
Henderson, Anya Forger placed first on that waiting list.
Henderson," If any of the current successful applicants were to withdraw,"
Henderson, she'll immediately get into the school.
Loid, B-But after what we did...
Henderson, Do you know what the number one k*ller of our species on this planet is?
Loid, Huh?
Henderson, It is the mosquito!
Henderson, Yes. You saved Master Swan from that brutal k*ller back there.
Henderson, That brought your score up tremendously.
Loid, That's insane.
Henderson," Stand proud, Forger."
Henderson, Your family is worthy of our school.
Yor," So if even one person withdraws, Miss Anya will get in?"
Henderson, Correct.
Yor, But if no one withdraws...
Henderson," Now, about that..."
Zachry Feiss, Th-The Thorn Princess?
Zachry Feiss, What are you doing here?
Yor," Secretary Zachry Feiss, I presume?"
Yor," If it's not too much trouble, I will be taking your life."
Zachry Feiss," Please, no! Spare me!"
Zachry Feiss, I have a son who's just about to turn six!
Zachry Feiss, He'll be starting at Eden College next month!
Zachry Feiss," If I die, he won't be able to go to school!"
Yor," I'm terribly sorry, but that's exactly why I'm doing this."
Zachry Feiss, Huh?!
Yor, For the sake of Miss Anya getting into the school...
Yor, I need you to die!
Yor," You mustn't, Yor!"
Yor," You mustn't take the life of an innocent person, Yor!"
Loid, Yor?
Yor," Oh, it's nothing."
Yor," I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Zachry Feiss."
Henderson," Well, no matter."
Henderson, There are a few that withdraw every year.
Henderson, Make sure you are properly prepared for the eventuality.
Loid," Thank you very much, Master Henderson."
Henderson, I must warn you that I may not be teaching here by the time you arrive.
Loid, What?
Henderson, I was forced to give that swine a good thrashing.
Henderson," I was able to protect Eden's honor, but who know what ramifications await me?"
Loid, That foolish man and this instructor...
Loid," I'm not sure which one will be more useful to me in my mission,"
Loid," but if that fool stands in my way, I have plenty of ways to destroy him."
Loid, Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
Henderson," I appreciate the attempt at consolation, my elegant boy."
Henderson, Just await that call at home.
Sign, Days Later
Anya, Anya will be accepted... Anya will be accepted...
Anya, Anya will be accepted... Anya will be accepted...
Loid, What in the world is she doing?
Yor," Apparently, she's performing a prayer dance to help her get accepted."
Anya, Anya will be accepted...
Loid, Oh... I see.
Anya, Kieeeeeeeh!
Loid," Hello, Forger residence."
Loid, Yes.
Loid, Yes.
Loid, Goodbye.
Loid, Anya got in!
Anya, Papa! I passed!
Loid," You did a great job, Anya!"
Anya, I did it!
Yor," Oh, thank goodness! What wonderful news!"
Yor, I'm so happy!
Loid," Thank you for all you did as well, Yor."
Franky, Heya. I heard she got in.
Franky, Time to celebrate!
Loid, You sure found out fast.
Franky, Never underestimate an informant.
Franky," Oh, you must be the missus. Pleasure to meet you!"
Franky," I'm Loid's friend, Franky!"
Yor, Hello.
Anya, Scruffy-scruff!
Franky," Let's get this party started! I got some booze, and I ordered delivery!"
Loid, Who do you think you are?
Franky, This is all thanks to me stealing the answer sheet.
Loid, You idiot! They'll hear you!
Yor, Huh? Wha wuz zat?
Franky," Are you even drinking, you party pooper?"
Loid, Leave me be.
Franky," Isn't it great, Anya?"
Franky, Daddy said he'll buy you anything as a reward just for today!
Loid, Hey! Don't go promising her things like that!
Anya," I don't want you to buy me anything, but I wanna do something!"
Loid, Hm? What's that?
Loid, I don't mind as long as it's doable.
Princess Honey," Save me, Bondman!"
Bondman," Wait for me, Princess Honey!"
TV Narrator, The kingdom's best spy infiltrates the castle...
TV Narrator, Bondman!
TV Narrator," Taking down any enemy that stands in his way,"
TV Narrator, he finally makes it to the princess.
Bondman," I'm here to save you, Princess Honey!"
Princess Honey, Bondman!
TV Narrator," Peace was restored to the castle, and their love continued to grow."
Anya, This is what I wanna do.
Loid," What you wanna do? Wait, you mean..."
Anya," I wanna play ""save Anya from the castle""!"
Loid, Nope. Not happening.
Franky, How cruel... You meanie!
Franky, I'm not going to school if you don't do this!
Loid, No one asked you to speak for her.
Franky," Oh, hey. I'm pretty sure that's Newston Castle."
Franky," I heard it was recently remodeled into some cartoon's theme park,"
Franky, but that's definitely it.
Franky," It's got the same kinds of tricks and traps seen in the show,"
Franky, and you can even rent it out.
Franky," The government doesn't have any eyes over there, Loidy Boy,"
Franky, so it wouldn't hurt to have a little bit of fun.
Loid, But...
Franky," After everything she went through to pass, too."
Franky," Doesn't seem fair if you can't get some kind of reward, huh, kiddo?"
Anya," Sniffle, sniffle..."
Anya," Sniffle, sniffle."
Anya, Sniffle...
Loid," All right, fine."
Franky," Right, then! Let's strike while the iron's hot!"
Franky, Leave the castle reservation to me. You're in charge of our ride!
Loid, Wha?! You expect us to go today?
Loid, And you want me to arrange this?
Franky," Well, of course! It's for your daughter!"
Comms Engineer, We have a message from Twilight.
Comms Engineer, Code GO.
Female Member, He did it.
Female Member," ""The sakura blossoms bloom."""
Comms Engineer, Another message from Twilight.
Female Member, What is it?
Comms Engineer, How shall I reply?
Chief, He might just be the best spy in all of Westalis...
Female Member, Get him what he needs at once!
Comms Engineer," Yes, ma'am!"
Comms Engineer, To Falcon in the Rhynnick region.
Comms Engineer, Emergency operation from Twilight.
Falcon," Falcon here. Roger the emergency operation from Twilight, over."
Loid," "" hours... Meet downstream on the Nein River in the Rhynnick region."""
Loid, They sure didn't waste any time.
Franky," Believe it or not, this castle can do this, too!"
Anya, I'm gonna make a quiz!
Franky," Hey, great idea!"
Franky, You seriously came through!
Anya, Anya's never been on a plane before! It's so exciting!
Franky," Nice, nice, nice!"
Loid, There we go.
Anya, Does Anya look cool?
Loid," Yes, you do."
Yor, Loid! Where did you get this li'l plane?
Yor, It's amazing!
Loid," Oh, some wonderful coworkers of mine are letting me borrow it."
Yor, Fank you for always looking after my husband.
Loid, You all have your seatbelts on? Here we go.
Franky and Anya, Let's go!
Anya, I'm so excited!
Franky, Yahoo!
Yor," Oh, it's so pretty."
Yor, It looks like a tweasure chest.
Anya," Papa, you're amazing!"
Franky, Look! There it is!
Franky, Holy crap!
Anya, The castle's so cool!
Loid," Hey, settle down!"
Loid, We're about to land. Make sure you're properly seated.
Anya, We're in a castle!
Loid, You don't need to go running around with her!
Yor, This is wonderful.
Loid, What's the matter?
Anya, Something's not right.
Loid, What do you mean by that?
Anya, Can you truly call a castle with no enemies or servants
Anya, a castle?
Anya, I'm sad.
Anya, I don't think I can go to school now.
Franky," I know, right? I can't blame ya, little missy."
Franky, Daddy better step up his game.
Comms Engineer, We have a report from Twilight.
Comms Engineer, He's requesting agents.
Comms Engineer, As many as possible.
Female Member, This will be a true test for WISE.
Comms Engineer, To all agents in Ostania.
Comms Engineer, Report to Newston Castle for an emergency operation.
Comms Engineer, This is an extremely important assignment regarding Operation Strix.
Comms Engineer, Mission rank is over SS.
Comms Engineer, I repeat: this is an extremely important assignment regarding Operation Strix.
Comms Engineer, Mission rank is over SS!
Agent , That's the real Twilight...
Agent , I gotta get his autograph later.
Franky, Look at your agency coming through for you.
Franky," Well, give them the rundown."
Franky, I'll explain the rest.
Loid," All right, fine."
Loid, Thank you very much for gathering here today on behalf of my daughter.
Agent , Morse code.
Agent ," ""Just listen quietly."""
Agent , Orders from Twilight!
Loid, I would like for all of you to play the part of the enemies
Loid, of a spy who is coming to save a princess.
Agent , I have absolutely no idea what's going on...
Agent , But this is Twilight we're talking about. I'm sure this is all according to plan.
Sign, This man will explain the details. Follow his orders from now on
Loid, Thank you again for doing this for my daughter.
Franky, All right! Let's announce the cast!
Franky, Here's our star for today!
Franky, Princess Anya!
Anya, This is the spy person who's gonna save me!
Anya, Loidman!
Anya, And the big bad boss!
Franky, Scruffy!
Anya, Count Scruffy Head!
Anya, And Mama... um...
Anya, can be whatever.
Yor, Shock!
Franky, And now...
Franky, to the very capable subordinates of Count Scruffy Head!
Franky, I need you all to put on your best performances
Franky, and get in Loidman's way as much as possible!
Loid, Uh... wait...
Agent , This mission ranking is over SS.
Agent , I'll make any sacrifice necessary to see this mission through!
Agent , I couldn't ask for a better opponent than Twilight!
Agent , This day has finally come...
Franky, You can all decide for yourselves how you're going to get in Loidman's way.
Franky, I am not exaggerating when I say the success of this plan is in your hands!
Loid, Uh... Where is this going?
Franky, My loyal minions!
Franky, Make Loidman suffer as much as possible for Princess Anya's sake!
Franky," Once you're all prepared, get to your positions!"
Agents, Roger!
Franky," Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff! Princess Anya is mine!"
Franky," If you want her back, come after me!"
Anya," Save me, Loidman."
Loid," Wait, it's already started?!"
Anya, Hey!
Franky, Loidman! You are about to face many obstacles in order to get the princess back!
Franky," First up,"
Franky," we have a quiz that the princess made up in this courtyard, so listen up!"
Franky," If you can't answer correctly, you'll be putting that on!"
Loid, This is...
Franky, You betcha! A Bondman costume set!
Anya, So exciting!
Franky," Okay, question time!"
Franky, What does Princess Anya like about Bondman?!
Loid, Huh? His face?
Anya, Bzzz! The fact that he has a p*stol with a sil*ncer!
Loid, What? Really?!
Franky," Oh, come on! You're her dad and you don't even know that?"
Loid, Next question!
Franky, What's Anya's favorite food?
Loid, Peanuts!
Anya, Ooh! Correct!
Franky, Tch. Guess that was too easy.
Franky, Here's the final question!
Franky," If you get it wrong, you'll be changing into that outfit, Loidman!"
Loid, That's if I don't get it.
Franky," Here's your question, then."
Franky, What does Anya want right now?
Loid, What does she want right now?
Franky, Five! Four!
Loid, You didn't say anything about a time limit!
Franky," I never said there wouldn't be one, either."
Loid, Calm down. What does Anya want right now?
Loid, What does she want...
Loid, Bondman's spy gear!
Franky," What's the correct answer, Princess Anya?!"
Anya, Right now...
Anya," I'm thirsty, so I'd like some water, please!"
Franky," Looks like you're wrong, Loidman!"
Loid, How the hell would I know that?!
Franky," Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!"
Franky," Too bad for you, Loidman!"
Franky," Now, let's have you keep your word!"
Anya, I'm so excited...
Anya, to see the real Loidman!
Anya, Loidman!
Franky," All right, then! On to the next stage!"
Loid," Hey, wait!"
Anya, Loidman!
Franky," If you want to save Princess Anya, you'll have to make your way up here!"
Franky," Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!"
Agent , He's so cool!
Agent , He's just so amazing...
Anya," You're so cool, Loidman!"
Franky," We're just getting started, scruff!"
Anya," Oh, no. Save me."
Loid," God, this is pain."
Anya," Loidman! Up here, up here!"
Anya, I'm right here!
Loid, There's no end to this.
Anya, This is so cool!
Franky," You've got this, my minions! Don't let him win!"
Franky," Loid! Let them hit you, damn it!"
Franky," Now you've done it, you bastard!"
Franky, Don't think you're gonna catch us that easily!
Franky, Buh-bye!
Anya," Save me, Loidman."
Anya," You're so amazing, Loidman!"
Franky," Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff! I'm impressed you got this far, Loidman!"
Franky, But I won't let you have the princess!
Anya," Save me, Loidman!"
Loid, Are you seriously telling me I have to act out this embarrassing
Loid, little play in front of all of these agents?
Loid, But in the end... this is for the mission!
Loid, H... Hand over the princess.
Agents, Ooh!
Agent , I can't believe we get to see Twilight's acting skills in person!
Franky, You fool! You think I'd hand her over that easily?!
Franky," Now, go! The most powerful witch in the world, Yorticia!"
Franky," Finish off that fool, scruff!"
Loid, Now there's a witch?!
Loid, What the hell is going on in this story?
Loid, Huh?
Loid, Wai—no way. What?!
Yor, Anyone who tries to kidnap Miss Anya...
Yor, will not get away alive!
Loid," Y-Yor, please calm down."
Loid, Why is she using physical att*cks when she's a witch?
Loid, She's strong!
Loid, She's gonna k*ll me!
Loid, Yor... Are you all right?
Franky," Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!"
Franky," Excellent work getting this far, Loidman!"
Franky, But you won't defeat me that easil—
Anya, So exciting!
Loid," I... I've come to save you, Princess Anya."
Anya, Papa!
Loid, Wait... I'm supposed to be your dad in this?
Anya, So sparkly!
Agent ," Congratulations, Anya!"
Franky, Anya...
Franky, Congratulations...
Loid, What is this?
Anya, I've had so much excitement ever since I left the orphanage!
Anya," It's all thanks to you, Papa!"
Loid, Hm? Oh... I'm happy for you.
Anya, I'm gonna do my best in school!
Loid, That's good.
Loid," Well, anyway... congratulations on getting into the school."
Female member," Sir, the expense report from Agent Twilight."
Chief, Are these numbers real?
Female member," Yes, they are."
Chief, But...
Female member, They are correct.
Sign, Mission Report
Sign, Operation Strix
Proprietress, And... ..
Anya, I'm two millimeters bigger than last time!
Loid, I'm sure it's just an error.
Proprietress, You never know. Kids grow up so quickly.
Yor, Indeed.
Loid," Well, with that in mind, we should probably have your uniform made a little bigger."
Proprietress," But it was quite a shock to hear that you were suddenly married, Yor."
Proprietress, You should have told me the last time you were here!
Yor," I'm, er, sorry about the other day."
Proprietress, And to think that your lovely daughter is going to the prestigious Eden College.
Proprietress, Congratulations.
Anya, Fank you very much.
Proprietress, Are you an Eden College alum?
Loid," Oh, no. I went to an insignificant little school out in the country."
Proprietress," Oh, then do be careful."
Proprietress, There's something of a wall between parents who are Eden alumni and those who aren't.
Proprietress," Apparently this causes discrimination and bullying among the children, too."
Proprietress," Oh, and hazing from the honor students,"
Proprietress, and conflict between the dorm kids and commuters.
Proprietress," Speaking of, I hear that kidnappings of commuter kids are on the rise."
Proprietress," It's not surprising, considering most of the kids who can attend Eden are rich."
Anya, I don't wanna go to school anymore.
Proprietress," Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you."
Proprietress," Don't worry. There are plenty of fun things about it, too."
Proprietress," Okay, all done with your measurements."
Proprietress," Let's see, you'll be getting one uniform,"
Proprietress," plus a winter coat, a vest, and a sweater, for three additional items."
Proprietress," You're a regular here, so I'll get those done immediately."
Proprietress," Oh, you'll be able to get everything else you need from the shop on the corner."
Loid, This is going to cost more than I thought.
Loid, What's the matter?
Anya, I am in fear that I will be kidnapped.
Loid," Oh, I see. You sure didn't waste any time."
Loid," Yor, is it all right if we eat out today?"
Yor," Yes, of course."
Anya, Are there any kidnappers at the restaurant?
Waiter, Here's our special for the day.
Waiter, Pork sauté in pawpaw sauce with porcini mushrooms and potato potage.
Anya, Po?
Loid, Looks delicious.
Loid, Must be cipher P.
Loid," Ah, a notice about my briefing."
Loid, It'll be in five days at hours at safe house D.
Loid, Understood.
Loid, But I really need to ask them to stop using this notification method.
Loid, There's something unpleasant about it.
Loid, Hello?
Loid," Oh, yes, hi."
Loid, What? It's done already?
Loid, All right. We'll come pick up the order today.
Loid, Thank you.
Anya, Is the uniform done?
Loid, Sounds like it.
Loid, But I have my briefing today.
Loid," I'm sorry to trouble you, Yor,"
Loid, but could you go pick it up with Anya for me?
Loid, I got called into work.
Yor, Of course. You can count on me.
Loid," I might not get home until late, so you can go ahead and get delivery for dinner."
Yor, All right.
Anya, Have a knees day.
WISE HandlerSylvia Sherwood Alias, Handler
Handler," Good day... or perhaps good evening, Agent Twilight."
Loid," Hello, Handler. What's this about?"
Handler, Before we get into that...
Handler, What in the world were all those expenses the other day?!
Handler," A castle rental fee, and rental fees for furniture to go in said castle?!"
Handler, You think we're made of money?!
Loid," Oh, here's a couple more bills, actually."
Loid, Going to school is apparently very expensive.
Handler, I have to admire the balls it takes to just casually hand me more bills.
Loid," Well, they're all necessary expenses."
Handler, Very well. Anyway...
Handler, I'm here today to brief you on phase of Operation Strix.
Handler," Though you're usually on the ball, so that may not be necessary."
Loid, Well... I may actually be off my game lately.
Handler, Phase requires a social gathering.
Handler," Before we get into the details, let's review how Eden works."
Handler, Eden College.
Handler," There are around , students"
Handler," ranging from the ages of six to nineteen, and the curriculum covers all thirteen years."
Handler," Academics, sports, the arts..."
Handler, They offer a top-class education in every field.
Handler, The students who manage to shine brighter than their fellow elites
Handler, are the honor students known as the Imperial Scholars.
Handler, The social gathering that Desmond attends
Handler, is only open to those Imperial Scholars and their parents.
Handler," In order to become an Imperial Scholar,"
Handler," a student must earn eight merits known as ""Stella."""
Handler, Stella Stars are awarded for exceptional grades and contributions to society.
Handler," Which means, first, you need to raise your daughter into an honor student."
Handler, You may use underhanded means if necessary.
Handler," On the other hand,"
Handler, poor grades and bad behavior will result in demerits called Tonitrus Bolts.
Handler," When a student receives eight of those, they will be immediately expelled,"
Handler, so be aware of that.
Handler," Now, let's work out the finer details."
Loid, Turning that child into a honor student...
Loid," Hello, anxiety, my old friend."
Anya, Do I look cute in my uniform?
Yor," Oh, you look absolutely adorable!"
Yor, Let's go to the portrait studio later!
Anya, Ta-da!
Anya, Do I look cute?
Yor," Oh, you look absolutely adorable!"
Proprietress, Could you leave already? How many times are you gonna say that?
Anya, I wanna go on an ooting in this!
Yor," Yes, let's do that!"
Proprietress, Thanks much.
Anya," Doot, do! Doot, do! Doot, do!"
Yor, Why don't we stop by the park?
Anya, This is my uniform. Ta-da!
Anya, I am wearing my uniform. Ta-da!
Mother A," My, your daughter's adorable."
Mother B, She goes to Eden? I'm so jealous.
Yor, Oh... Hello.
s child," Mom, I'm hungry."
Mother A, And what would you like for dinner?
s child, Hamburg steak!
Swan, So you do prefer your old mother.
Anya, I want to be with them forever.
Yor, I know that we're just a pretend family.
Yor, But...
Yor, Maybe I could be more of a mother to her.
Anya, Mama!
Anya, I just showed everyone how cute I am!
Yor, Make sure you don't dirty your uniform before you go to school.
Yor," Say, Miss Anya. Why don't we stop by the supermarket on our way home?"
Yor," Loid said he was going to be home late, so I'll make dinner tonight."
Anya, Ooh!
Anya," Can you cook, Mama?"
Yor, Yes. I will do my very best.
Thug A," Hey, is that kid from Eden?"
Thug B, Huh?
Thug A, Is the chick next to her the mom?
Thug B, She's gotta be the hired help.
Thug B, No rich person's gonna go shopping themselves.
Thug A," You know, I think I want an allowance."
Thug B," Me, too."
Yor, I'm sure I'll be able to make something if I have some meat and vegetables.
Yor," I'm not sure what any of these are,so I'll just buy all of them."
Anya, Ta-da!
Anya, I'm going outside now. I'm bored.
Yor," Oh, don't wander off too far!"
Thug A," Hello there, little lady."
Thug B, Be a good girl for just a little bit.
Thug B," Once your maid pays up, we'll let you go."
Anya, Bad guys!
Proprietress, Eden has bullying and kidnappings...
Anya, She was right!
Thug C, I heard you can even sell their uniforms for a sweet price.
Thug B," Excellent. In that case, little lady, let's take your—"
Yor, What do you think you're doing?
Thug A," Uh-oh! Looks like we're gonna have to tack on some medical bills, too."
Thug A," Let's see your wallet, Miss Hired Help."
Yor," I'm afraid I used up all of my cash, so I have none left."
Yor, So I must ask you to leave.
Thug A, I see. Then I guess we're just gonna have to strip the little lady.
Thug A," You're gonna be fired anyway,"
Thug A," so go back to the countryside, you shitty little maid!"
Thug A, Sh-She destroyed that pumpkin with her bare hand?!
Yor, I am that girl's mother!
Yor," If you do not want to end up like that vegetable, leave at once!"
Anya, Mama...
Yor, Are you all right?
Yor, I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have let you out of my sight.
Yor," There, there..."
Yor, And I've ruined all of the ingredients...
Yor, I'm such a failure as a mother.
Anya, But I love that my Mama is so strong and cool.
Anya," There, there."
Anya," k*ller punch, kapow!"
Yor, I-I'm so embarrassed!
Anya, Mama!
Anya," Train me, please!"
Yor, T-Train you?
Anya, I know it's really dangerous to be an Eden student now.
Anya, But it won't be as scary if I train!
Anya, I can do my best at school without dying!
Anya," I wanna be like you, Mama!"
Yor," Even if I can't be like a normal mother,"
Yor, I'm going to do everything I can for her.
Yor, All right. Let's go straight home and start your training.
Anya, Training!
Loid, I'm home...
Yor, Hah! Hah!
Loid, What are you doing?
Yor, Preparing her to go to school!
Anya, Hah!
Yor, Hah!
Loid, Yeah... I'm filled with nothing but anxiety.
Anya, Hah!
Yor, Hah!
Anya, Hah!
Headmaster, You are truly the chosen.
Headmaster," Due to your hard work, or perhaps your parents,"
Headmaster, you have made it to the hallowed halls of Eden.
Headmaster, To our honorable new students...
Headmaster," Congratulations, and welcome to our school."
Headmaster, Everyone here at Eden welcomes you from the bottom of our hearts.
Loid, We finally made it this far...
Anya," Papa, a lot of people are wearing the same thing I am."
Loid, Yes. That's what a uniform is.
Loid," I still have a mountain of problems to tackle, but..."
Handler," Listen up, Twilight."
Handler, There are requirements to attend Desmond's social gathering.
Handler, The student must be an Imperial Scholar.
Handler," And for that to happen, they must receive plenty of merits."
Handler, Do not forget that the future of the East and West depends on this mission.
Loid, Turning this child into an elite...
Loid, I've mostly given up on that task.
Anya, Shock!
Loid, This school is already filled with the best of the best.
Loid, It'll be difficult to maintain a top position.
Loid, More importantly...
Instructor," Next, we will announce the houses and their housemasters."
Instructor, Please come forward when your name is called.
Instructor, Class one: Specter Hall.
Instructor, William Howard.
Instructor, Theodore Russell.
Instructor, Grace Fein.
Instructor, Jessica Clark.
Instructor," Next, we have class two: Cline Hall."
Anya, I wonder what class I'm gonna be in.
Loid, Who knows?
Instructor, Lucy Garrett.
Loid, Actually... I do.
Loid, Because I changed parts of the lineups to help with my mission.
Instructor, Class three: Cecile Hall.
Instructor, Alice Paulette.
Loid, To ensure that Anya...
Instructor, Edward Perkshire.
Instructor, Damian Desmond.
Loid, would be in the same class as him.
Loid," The second son of my target, Donovan Desmond..."
Loid, Damian.
Damian, That's Lord Damian to you.
Loid, He got into Eden just like his older brother.
Loid, I've had my eye on him ever since I saw his name on the list of students applying.
Instructor, Jesse Capel.
Loid," If plan A to get Anya to become an Imperial Scholar proves too difficult,"
Loid, we'll go to plan B.
Loid, I call it... the Friendship Scheme.
Loid, Step one: be in the same class as him and become friends.
Loid, Step two: be invited to his house and bring me along.
Loid, Step three: direct contact with the target!
Loid," I'm sure it won't actually go that easily,"
Loid," but the more insurance we have, the better."
Instructor, Anya Forger.
Loid, Go ahead.
Loid, Anya must have grown up around kids her age at the orphanage for years.
Loid, I'll put my faith in her communication skills.
Anya, That's the evil boss's kid.
Damian, What's with her?
Damian," Heh, I see."
Damian, She's already realized how amazing I am and fallen for me.
Damian," You've got good taste, kid."
Damian," Playing hard to get, I see. Cute."
Instructor, Becky Blackbell.
Anya, Geh...
Becky, Pleasure to meet you!
Loid, That's...
Loid," The daughter of the CEO of the major m*llitary contractor, Blackbell."
Loid, What?! And behind her is the daughter of the vice president of parliament!
Loid," And among the boys, there's the son of one of the key members of the secret service!"
Loid, Her classmates are a treasure trove of intel!
Loid," Make sure you become friends with all of them, Anya!"
Yor, Loid gets so worked up when it comes to his daughter.
Becky, I'm Becky! What's your name?
Becky, She looks like a baby. I guess I wouldn't mind taking care of her a bit.
Anya, Hmph.
Instructor, Those will be the students in class three.
Becky, Hey!
Loid, Hello?!
Instructor, And you will be under the tutelage of Master Henderson.
Yor," Oh, it's the nice teacher."
Loid, So he didn't get fired after all.
Loid," I feel it's unfair for a housemaster to have to teach new students,"
Loid, but I guess it could've been much worse.
Henderson, I'll just have to whip these rugrats into shape like I used to.
Instructor," And now, the new students will accompany their homeroom teachers on a tour of the campus,"
Instructor, then head to their respective classrooms.
Instructor," During that time, there will be a meet and greet in Tower C's lounge for the guardians."
Loid," Do your best, Anya."
Loid, You'll be on your own from here on out.
Anya, Okey-dokey!
Henderson, You there! Stay in line!
Loid, I'm so worried...
Yor, It is always nerve-racking to send them off into the world.
Yor, I totally understand.
Henderson, This is the dining hall.
Henderson, The best chefs will present you with the most elegant dishes daily.
Henderson, Beyond those doors is a special dining hall reserved only for Imperial Scholars.
Henderson, Anyone can become an Imperial Scholar if they achieve elegant grades and earn eight Stella.
Henderson, I trust that you will all do your best.
Children," Yes, sir!"
Henderson," However, those who fall behind"
Henderson," will receive Tonitrus Bolts and face punishment or expulsion, so stay on your toes."
Anya, Why are you looking at me?
Emile, Lord Damian's gonna be an Imperial Scholar in no time!
Damian, Of course I am.
Ewen, We'd expect nothing else!
Damian," I mean, my father is the head of the National Unity Party."
Student A," Wait, really?!"
Student B, Wow!
Student C, My Papa says we owe a lot to the Desmond Group!
Henderson, Silence! No private conversations!
Becky, They're so dumb.
Damian, What about you? What does your father do?
Damian," If he's important enough, I'd consider letting you be my friend, too."
Anya, I will stay calm for the mission.
Anya, He's a sp—a feelings doctor.
Damian, Hmph. So he's just a nobody.
Damian," You're probably not that rich, either. Lame."
Anya, I wanna go play at your house.
Ewen," You moron! Know your place, uggo!"
Ewen, This is the problem with measly little peasants.
Emile, You're gonna get your gross peasant germs on him! Scram!
Anya, Now is the time for me tounleash my k*ller punch!
Yor," Listen carefully, Miss Anya."
Anya, Gasp!
Yor, Anyone who lets their emotions control their fists
Yor, does not know the meaning of true strength.
Yor," If someone's just being a little mean,"
Yor," being able to laugh it off makes you the cooler, bigger girl."
Anya, A big girl!
Yor," And if you can keep a smile on your face, fights will not happen."
Becky," Hey, stop being so pathetic. At least say something back."
Anya, Heh. Like I care.
Anya, Heh.
Damian, H-How dare she smirk at me like she's mocking me?!
Becky, Look at that composure! She's so mature! Amazing!
Becky, I was wrong about her being a baby!
Becky, You're way more grown-up than I thought. I'm impressed.
Anya, I'm a grown-up?
Anya, Heh.
Damian," Don't get cocky, you stupid uggo!"
Damian," Uggo, uggo, Queen Uggo!"
Ewen," Lord Damian, perhaps you should broaden your vocabulary..."
Becky, What's your problem?
Becky," Sure, she's uglier than me, but you don't have to be so mean."
Damian, Shut your mouth!
Henderson, You there! How many times must I warn you?
Henderson, Do you want punishments on your first day?
Damian, Curse you... How dare you embarrass me like that?!
Damian, You'll pay for this!
Anya," Mama, you liar. Smiling didn't help at all."
Becky," If you don't quit it, I'm gonna tell the teacher!"
Damian, What? You have proof that we did it?
Ewen and Emile," Yeah, yeah!"
Damian, Go on. Move!
Damian," Hey, you smug uggo!"
Damian, I'm gonna bully you every single day!
Damian, I'm gonna teach you a lesson so you'll never be able to smirk again!
Emile, Her feelings doctor father might be able to fix her if she cries.
Damian," Seriously? Well, that's impressive!"
Damian, Aren't you a special widdle girl?
Damian," Hey, where do you think you're looking? You scared?"
Henderson, What is the meaning of this?!
Emile, Sir! She just punched Lord Damian!
Anya," I just reached out my hand ,and somehow, he ran into it."
Ewen, You liar! You're not fooling anyone!
Emile, You were even making sure the teacher wasn't looking earlier!
Anya, You got any proof I did it?
Ewen, You left the imprint of your fist on his face!
Henderson," I trust you are aware that perjury is a disgraceful act,"
Henderson, Anya Forger.
Becky," That's not what happened, sir!"
Becky," She was holding back all day, but these bullies just..."
Henderson, So it's true that she hit him?
flashback Yor," Listen carefully, Miss Anya."
Anya, Gasp!
Yor," The only time it's all right for you to use force is, for example,"
Yor, if you're saving a friend in trouble.
Anya, H-Her foot...
Anya, He stepped on it.
Anya, So I got mad...
Anya, I'm sorry.
Becky, She did that for me?!
Becky," Oh, Anya!"
Henderson," She held back her own personal anger,"
Becky," Thank you! Thank you, Anya!"
Henderson, and had the courage to stand up to a lad for her friend.
Becky, I'm so moved!
Henderson," Truly elegant, Anya Forger."
Henderson, But I'm afraid...
Loid, So the Desmonds didn't appear after all.
Loid," Well, there's no need to rush."
Loid," Now that she's enrolled, we have all the time in the world."
Staff, Ladies and gentlemen.
Staff," The students' orientation is now complete, so please head toward the courtyard."
Loid, And I was able to make some connections.
Staff," If you would gather round, we will take a group photo."
Loid, Where's Anya?
Henderson, Forger.
Henderson, Come with me.
Loid, She punched a boy?
Yor, Are you hurt at all?
Loid, And it just happened to be Desmond's son?
Henderson," Usually, acts of v*olence would immediately mean three Tonitrus Bolts..."
Loid, What in the world?
Henderson," But at my discretion, it became one."
Henderson, That is as much as I can do.
Yor," I'm terribly sorry, Loid! All because I trained her..."
Henderson," I will speak with his parents, too."
Loid, It's the first day of school and she lost a point.
Loid," To top it off, her relationship with Damian couldn't be any worse."
Photographer," All right, everyone! We're taking the picture!"
Photographer, The family on the right over there! Smile a little more!
Photographer," Say, ""Cheese!"""

Loid," In order to get closer to him,"
Loid," I successfully had Anya enroll in Eden College, the school his son attends."
Loid," Next, in order to attend the social gathering that Desmond goes to,"
Loid," I need Anya to obtain eight merits, called ""Stella,"""
Loid, so that she can become an Imperial Scholar.
Loid," To make this all happen at a prestigious school, however, would not be easy."
Loid," That is why I formulated a plan B, ""The Friendship Scheme."""
Loid," I was hoping to have Anya get closer to Desmond's son, Damian,"
Sign, Come over!
Loid, which in turn would hopefully connect us as their parents.
Sign, Welcome
Sign, Thank you
Loid," But on the first day, she ended up punching Damian,"
Loid," earned a Tonitrus Bolt, and left their friendship in shambles."
Loid," Alas, it is too early to give up."

Yor, Good mworning...
Loid," Good morning, Yor. Breakfast is ready."
Loid, Looks like the three of us are getting used to life as a family.
Loid, Is Anya still asleep?
Loid, She's still worried about what happened yesterday?
Loid, Come on out. I won't get mad.
Loid," Eat quickly, or you'll be late."
Anya, I'm sorry I'm bad at school.
Yor," No, that was my fault."
Loid, There's no point to worrying about the past.
Loid, Just make sure you don't get into any more fights.
Loid," Okay, come on. Cheer up."
Loid, Your classes start today.
Yor," You're so kind, Loid."
Loid, Figuring out what we can do next is far more constructive than dwelling on the past.
Loid," Besides, it would be much worse if she somehow"
Loid, got sick of school and didn't want to go anymore.
Loid, I need her school life to go as smoothly as possible for the sake of this mission.
Loid," Oh, and make sure you apologize to Damian at school today."
Loid, Got it?
Anya, Yep. Gonna go now.
Loid, Do your best and be a good girl!
Yor," It's time for us to head to work, too."
Loid, Yes.
Loid," I'm counting on you, Anya."
Loid, The peace of the world rests on you two making amends.
Anya, Anya will do her best.
Driver," Have a wonderful day, Miss Becky."
Anya, Miss Rich Girl!
Becky," Oh, Anya. Good day to you."
Anya," Do you live in a castle, Miss Rich Girl?"
Becky, Of course not.
Becky, You came here on the school bus?
Becky, I could have my driver give you a ride to and from school from now on.
Anya," Does that mean I get to be a Miss Rich Girl, too?"
Becky, I never said anything about adopting you.
Becky," Aw, I'm jealous of the dorm kids who don't have to go to and from school."
Becky, Bleh...
Emile," What do you mean, ""Bleh""? You rude little girl!"
Becky," Ugh, it's only morning and you're already obnoxious."
Emile, What's her problem?
Ewen, Know your place!
Becky, Nyah!
Loid, Make sure you apologize.
Anya, Um...
Anya," Um, yesterday, I..."
Becky," Let's go, Anya. Our class is about to start."
Ewen," Hey, wait!"
Becky, You'll just catch their stupid if you keep talking to them.
Anya, But world peace!
Sign," He was worried, so he came to check on her"
Loid," Stop getting in the way, Blackbell girl!"
Loid," No, wait."
Loid," As I recall, Blackbell and the Desmond Group are actually business partners."
Loid, Could this girl be under orders from an enemyorganization to put a stop to our mission?
Loid," No, calm down. That's not possible."
Loid, First impressions are the most important thing when forming a group of friends at school.
Loid," They must make amends today, no matter what."
Becky, You know...
Becky, Hm.
Alice," That's the girl who got violent, right?"
Jesse, How scary! So barbaric.
Sara, Is the girl next to her another delinquent?
Johnny," She just hit him out of nowhere without a reason, right? That's nuts."
Male student B, I don't want to be in the same class as her.
Female student A," What if she hits me, too?"
Male student A, I can't believe she came to school. Talk about a pain.
Anya, School is scary...
Becky, People are so shallow.
Becky, They can only judge what's on the surface.
Anya," Are you a smart person, Rich Girl?"
Becky," Aw, I wouldn't say that."
Becky," And call me Becky, not ""Rich Girl."""
Instructor," All right, be seated."
Becky, I hope we become the best of friends.
Becky," I'm the only one who knows how good you are, Anya."
Female student B," Honestly, people like that are just..."
Male student B, We'd better stay away from them.
Anya," School is scary, but I think it might be okay."
Becky," Hey, look! Isn't this cute?"
Emile, Tch!
Ewen," Why don't you give them a piece of your mind, Lord Damian?"
Damian, That's right. My name is Damian Desmond.

Instructor," And that's why this turns out like this, and this is... this."
Instructor, So you get this answer by doing this...
Instructor," And if you get this answer, you can use the same method to get the answer over here."
Instructor, She had the nerve to fall asleep in first period on her first day.
Instructor, Is she actually a delinquent?
Instructor, How scary.
Becky, Anya!
Becky, We have science class next. Wake up!
Anya, Second son!
Anya, I have to apologize to the second son.
Becky, Second son? You mean Damian?
Becky, He already left.
Becky, And just leave that loser alone.
Anya, But peace will be in trouble if I don't apologize to the second son.
Becky, You mean it'll put a damper on your peaceful school life?
Becky," I mean, yeah... Who knows what that boy will try to do?"
Becky, But don't worry.
Becky," I'm on your side, Anya!"
Becky," I'll protect you, no matter what."
Anya," Oh, it's okay, then."
Becky, Yes.
Loid," No, it's not!"
Anya, Papa?!
Loid, I need a way to tell her how important that apology is!
Sign, Science Class
Sign, <Fortune for Good Little Children>It is good to apologize today.
Anya," Is that you, God?!"
Loid," Apologize, Anya. Reconcile with him."
Anya, I suddenly feel this intense pressure.
Male student C," ""And that's when John made up his mind."
Sign, Language Class
Male student C," Even if he were to be left out, he was going to see his beliefs through."
Male student C," And then John never apologized to anyone ever again."""

Anya, My textbook seems different from everyone else's...
Sign, Lunchtime
Becky, It's finally time for lunch. Let's go to the cafeteria.
Becky, I guess this really is a prestigious school.
Becky, We're getting pretty brutal lessons from day one.
Becky, I'm exhausted.
Female Instructor," New students, you can order whatever you'd like for lunch."

Becky," Huh... Well, they're nowhere near as talented as my chef."
Anya, Anya wants omelet rice.
Becky, What a bizarre dish.
Anya, Second son!
Becky," Ew, go eat in your dorm."
Anya, I have to apologize.
Becky," No, you don't."
Becky, They're the ones at fault.
Loid, That stupid little brat!
Loid, That's it. I need to get her away from Anya.
Senior waiter," Hey, newbie! Where are you going?!"
Loid, Becky Blackbell from Class -.
Loid, Come to the student hall in Tower A immediately.
Becky, Huh? But I'm still eating.
Loid, Now!
Becky, Ugh!
Anya, Now's my chance to apologize.
Ewen, Wh-What do you want?! You wanna fight again?
Anya, Um—
Emile," If you hadn't sucker punched him, Lord Damian never would've lost to you!"
Anya, Um...
Damian," Shut up, you two."
Emile, Huh? I see. You're going to personally give her what for!
Damian, Why do I find it so hard to speak when she's in front of me?
Ewen, Lord Damian?
Damian, What is this awkward sensation I'm feeling in my chest?
Anya," I feel a weird chill. I betterapologize quick, then run away."
Emile," Knowing Lord Damian,"
Emile, I'm sure he's finding the absolute perfect insults to rip this little girl to shreds!
Ewen," I wonder what he'll go for? ""Shrimp""?"
Ewen," No, that is far too meek."
Emile, Super uggo? Raccoon face?

Anya, I...
Emile, She's even got those lame hair things that look like horns.
Anya, Y-Yesterday...
Ewen, Your momma's so fat...

Anya, I'm r-really sorry...
Anya, that I suddenly hit you yesterday!
Anya, I just wanted...
Anya, to be friends with you.
Anya, I'm sorry...
Anya, for having stubby little legs.
Damian, Sh-She felt so bad that she's actually bawling?!
Damian, She's so demure.
Loid, I guess I didn't really need to interfere.
Loid," Well done, Anya. Good job apologizing."
Ewen," Lord Damian, your face is bright red."
Damian, That's just because... I'm enraged!
Damian, I would never...
Damian, That's right. She defied me! Right to my face!
Damian, Yes...
Damian, She came right up to me...
Damian, Stared deep into my eyes...
Damian, N-No! That's not what's going on!
Damian," Stop pounding, my stupid heart!"
Damian, She's a commoner! I would never...
Damian," No, never!"
Damian, That's just too embarrassing.
Damian, Damn it all! I'd rather die than ever admit it!
Damian, I will never forgive you! My pride will not allow it!
Ewen," Well said, Lord Damian! A woman's tears cannot sway him!"
Emile, We'll let you off the hook for today.
Emile, Lord Damian!

Loid," That makes the denominator three, and you get one-third."
Loid," Which means you have three thirds, which is equal to one."
Loid," Simple, right?"
Yor," L-Loid, why don't you both take a break?"
Loid, Absolutely not. She has to learn at least this much by today.
Loid, The incident with Damian the other day...
Loid," The ""Friendship Scheme"" that was meant to bring us closer to the Desmonds..."
flashbackDamian, I will never forgive you!
Loid, completely fell apart.
Loid," Which means we need to go with the orthodox method of Plan A,"
Loid, and boost its chances of success as much as possible.
Loid," If you don't finish this, you don't get to watch your spy cartoon tonight."
Loid, Well? What's the answer here?
Anya, I'll finish this quick by reading Papa's mind.
Loid, Come on. You use this formula here...
Loid internal," In order to get the Stella needed to become an Imperial Scholar,"
Loid internal, there are other methods such as excelling in sports
Loid internal, or doing community service.
Loid internal, But in order to halt getting Tonitrus Bolts from bad grades
Loid internal," Though honestly, the most absolute way to get to the social gathering"
Loid internal," or being expelled from them, we need to get her academic skills up."
Loid internal," is to infiltrate it, but over the past few years, fellow agents have..."
Loid internal, I could enter the faculty roomand alter documents...
Yor," Are you all right, Miss Anya?!"
Anya, I will read Mama's mind.
Anya," Mama, this question..."
Yor, Let's think it over together.
Yor," Let's see... The denominator is five, so that's one split into five."
Yor," Um... To make this easier to understand,"
Yor, let's rip all four limbs off of a torso...
Yor," Oh, but then the head gets in the way."
Yor, Huh? Um...
Yor, Five... Five?
Yor, Doesn't a five look like an S?
Yor," Are you all right, Miss Anya?!"
Loid, What's wrong? Well? Why can't you solve this?
Loid, I honestly can't figure out what it is she can't understand.
Anya, I don't wanna study!
Loid," Hey, wait a minute!"
Yor, L-Loid...
Yor, I don't think it's a good idea to be too forceful at times like this.
Loid," Yes, but she needs to study more to become an Imperial Scholar."
Yor, But is that something she wants for herself?
Loid, Well...
Loid, That's actually for my mission.
Yor, I would really like Miss Anya to enjoy going to school.
Yor," Of course, she may need to studyso that she doesn't get expelled."
Loid, Yes... You're right.
Loid," She's still very young,"
Loid, so getting good grades is probably the least of her worries.
Yor," Oh, I'm sorry."
Yor, I shouldn't butt into another family's affairs.
Loid," No, it's quite all right. Thank you, Yor."
Loid, I do lose my composure with her at times.
Yor, I'm sure other parents go through the same thing.
Yor, Let's take a break.
Yor, I'll make us some tea.
Loid," Anya, we made you some hot cocoa."
Loid, And now she's holed up in her room.
Yor, I guess she's sulking now.
Anya, I'm gonna do my best in school!
Yor, She reminds me of my little brother when he was small.
Yor, She'll come out eventually.
Loid," By the way, your brother works for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, right?"
Loid, He must have a brilliant academic record.
Loid, Did you help him with his homework?
Loid, If you have any tips for me...
Yor," Oh, no. Yuri was a much more capable child than I was."
Yor," I'm embarrassed to admit it, but he probably taught me more than I taught him."
Yor, Whenever we'd study together...
Young Yuri," No, Sis. Spiders actually aren't insects."
Young Yuri," Insects have six legs,"
Young Yuri," and their bodies are split up between their head, thorax, and abdomen."
Young Yor," Wow... You're so knowledgeable, Yuri."
Yor," Whenever I complimented him, his smile would light up the room."
Young Yuri," Sis! Next, I'll teach you history!"
Young Yor, S-Sure...
Yor," He must've enjoyed teaching me things,"
Yor, because he'd always study on his own even when I left him alone.
Young Yuri," Sis, wake up! I learned my times tables! Listen!"
Young Yor, Mrfh...
Loid, I see. So part of his motivation was earning your praise.
Yor," I'm not so sure about that,"
Yor," but if that is the case, perhaps you can be someone like that for Miss Anya."
Yor, It might be worth it to praise her for the smallest things.
Yor, I think that'll make Miss Anya happy.
Loid, Well... I'm not so sure about that.
Loid," I'm not her real father, after all."
Loid," Wait, no."
Loid, That's right. I need to be the ideal father.
Loid, I need to play that part.
Loid, That was the foundation of this mission.
Loid," But up until now, nothing has been ideal,"
Loid," and as a father, I've been..."
Yor, It's all right.
Yor, Please be more confident in yourself.
Yor, Don't you remember what Miss Anya said?
Yor, That we're a perfect points.
Yor," To Miss Anya, you're a wonderful father."
Loid, I'm grateful to hear you say that.
Yor," Oh, no. I butted in as a stranger again."
Loid," No, Yor."
Loid," You're not a stranger, nor part of someone else's family."
Loid," Right now, you're the mother of the Forgers."
Loid, I'm counting on you to provide whatever I'm lacking.
Yor, Th-That's right. I'm actually someone's wife.
Loid, Don't say things like that when we're out of the house.
Loid," It would be great if you could look over Anya's homework, too."
Yor," Of course, if you think I can be of help."
Yor, Let's take our time and do our best together.
Loid," That's right. Don't panic, Twilight."
Loid," If this could be ended by assassinating Desmond alone,"
Loid," there would be countless methods,"
Loid, but that won't get us to a true solution.
Loid, Nothing goes well in a short amount of time.
Loid," You need to know what your targetis thinking, what they desire,"
Loid, then gain their trust and get close to them so you can keep an eye on them.
Loid, Completing such mundane missions that require patience makes a true spy.
Loid," First, I need to truly understand Anya."
Yor," Oh, look at the time."
Loid, I'll go have a chat with Anya.
Yor, Then I'll go ahead and do the dishes.
Loid," Hey, Anya. Your spy show's about to start."
Loid, I'm sorry about earlier.
Loid," Let's watch your show first,"
Loid, and then we can figure out what to do about your studies.
Loid, Anya?
Loid, She fell asleep.
Loid, You're going to catch a cold.
Loid, She was studying on her own?
Anya, I have to get the best grades on my tests for Papa...

Anya," No, Mama. You can't k*ll Papa..."
Loid, What exactly is she dreaming about?
Anya, Zzz...
Loid," A wonderful father, huh?"
Loid, I wonder what it'd feel like to have a real family.

Yor, I was so relieved our marriage went throughthat I blanked on everything else!
Millie, Say... is your younger brother a hottie?
Millie," Aw, he's a total cutie!"
Yor, Yes. Yuri is quite adorable.
Yor," He would always call me ""Sis"" and refused to leave my side."
Sign, The State Security Service
Millie," Yikes, so he's obsessed with his sister. Pass."
Sharon," If your brother looks up to you so much,isn't it kinda mean to forget to tell him that?"
First Lieutenant, Let's start one more time from the beginning.
First Lieutenant, How many and what kind of files did you take from city hall?
First Lieutenant, Who did you sell them to?
First Lieutenant, What do they look like?What is their contact information?
First Lieutenant," When, where, and how many times did you meet with them?"
Hayward, Please let me go home.
Narrator, The State Security Service.
Narrator, An organization whose goal is to maintain the peace within their nation.
First Lieutenant," Since we're both so good at talking, let's continue, Mr. Hayward."
Narrator, Its main duties include spy hunting and keeping an eye on the citizens.
First Lieutenant, What do you say?
Narrator," To complete their missions, they frequently use v*olence,"
Narrator," wiretapping, intimidation, and t*rture."
Narrator," The citizens called them the ""secret police,"" and they are feared."
Yuri," Great work, First Lieutenant. The boss asked me to take over the questioning."
First Lieutenant," All right. I'll leave the rest to you,"
First Lieutenant, Second Lieutenant Briar.
Yuri," Yes, sir! I'll do my best!"
Narrator," Yuri Briar, age twenty."
Narrator, He is a member of the secret police.
Second lieutenant, Why did the boss bring such a softie into our team?
Second lieutenant," I admit that he's good, but frankly, he's just a kid."
Second lieutenant, Some elite from the Ministry of ForeignAffairs who quickly rose up the ranks.
First lieutenant, When I talked to the boss...
Chief," Huh? Well, isn't Yuri adorable?"
Chief, He's like some cute little puppy.
First Lieutenant, And that was all.
Second Lieutenant, I-I see...
First Lieutenant," Well, our organization needs a kid like him sometimes."
First Lieutenant," Not to mention, he knows how to do the job,"
First Lieutenant, and he can be quite indiscriminate.
Yuri," Hello, Mr. Hayward!"
Hayward, You won't get anything out of m—
Yuri, My older sister actually works at city hall just like you do!
Hayward, Huh?
Yuri," Maybe you know her. She's pretty and kind, and I'm super proud of her!"
Yuri, I'm actually going to celebrate her marriage today.
Yuri," I haven't seen her in forever, so I'm really excited!"
Yuri," So, yeah. I'd like to get this over with quickly so I can go home."
Yuri, Why don't you just spit it all out already?
Hayward, I-I don't know anything!
Yuri, Here are photos of your deals.
Yuri," This is you, isn't it, Mr. Hayward?"
Secretary," Second Lieutenant, you—"
Secretary, How long were you holding on to important evidence like this?!
Yuri," Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to submit them."
Yuri, You'd be much better off if you were honest.
Heyward," So, I was just giving them the papers in exchange for cash."
Heyward, All I know about him is that he's from the West. I don't even know his name.
Yuri, Was there anything awkward about this man's looks or speech?
Yuri, Perhaps he didn't act his age?
Heyward," No, nothing like that."
Yuri, I see. In that case...
Yuri," Does the name ""Twilight"" sound familiar to you?"
Heyward, Who?
Yuri," He's a spy from the West. Apparently, a master of disguise."
Yuri, He is the villain who is trying to make this world fall into chaos.
Yuri, You could call him my natural enemy.
Heyward," I-If I helped you catch him, could we just forget about all this?"
Yuri, Do you know something?
Heyward," Er, no, but let me remember..."
Yuri," If you feed me false information, you'll be committing another crime, so do be careful."
Heyward, I just wanted extra money so I could fool around with girls! I didn't mean any harm.
Yuri," You have a wife, don't you?"
Heyward," You're a man, too! You must understand!"
Heyward, I was just selling some documents. I'm no political criminal.
Heyward, Let me off the hook! Please!
Yuri," Mr. Hayward, you see..."
Yuri, I haven't told my sister that I work for the State Security Service.
Yuri," It's a particularly dangerous job, so it'd just worry her."
Yuri," And above all, I don't want her to know how much dirty work I do."
Yuri," Mr. Hayward, what you've done is treason."
Yuri," Perhaps they were nothing more than pieces of paper to you,"
Yuri, but they may very well put many of our citizens in danger.
Yuri, Do you understand?!
Yuri," Unlike you, I love my family... my sister."
Yuri, I will do anything to protect this country where my sister lives.
Yuri, And I do mean anything.
Bondman, I don't care how much you t*rture me!
Bondman, I will never... sell out my friends!
Enemy," Curse you and your resilience, Bondman!"
Loid, If only she could concentrate on her studies like this.
Bondman, I only have two b*ll*ts left.
Anya, How many b*ll*ts can Bondman's p*stol hold?
Loid, Hm? I'm pretty sure it was eight.
Anya, So that's two-eighths!
Loid, Yes! You're right!
Anya, He has two-eighths of his b*ll*ts left!
Loid, How do you even know those words?
Loid, So the cartoon makes things easier for her to understand?
Yor," Th-Th-Th-Th-There's trouble, Loid!"
Loid," Welcome home, Yor."
Anya, He has two-eighths of his b*ll*ts left!
Yor," Yuri... I mean, my younger brother is coming here today!"
Loid, Today?!
Yor," So, yes..."
Yor, He insists on coming over and congratulating us.
Yor," What shall we do? He won't find out that this marriage is fake, will he?"
Loid, Don't worry.
Loid, I've prepared lovey-dovey couple accessories for just this sort of occasion.
Anya, Papa and Mama are flirting.
Loid and Yor, We are not!
Anya, Mama's little brother still isn't here?
Loid, You mean your uncle.
Anya, Unkie...
Loid, It's late. You should go to bed.
Anya," Anya will greet Unkie, too..."
Yor, It appears as though he's still stuck at work.
Yuri," I got a little worked up, and now I'm late."
Yuri," Ah, but..."
Yuri," I'll finally be able to see Sis! It's been so long! La, la!"
Yuri, Hurgh!
Yuri, I can feel the ribs that my sister broke before tingling.
Yuri," I'm remembering her loving embrace, and now my whole body is tingling!"
Yuri, But why in the world did my sister wait a whole year to tell me she was married?
Yuri, Could he be some foul villain that she's afraid of introducing to me?!
Yuri, I will eliminate every thr*at within this country where my sister lives.
Yuri," That includes her husband, too."
Yuri, Loid Forger...
Yuri," If he's some shithead who's threatening my sister, I'll throw him in a cell immediately."
Yuri," No, calm down. She mustn't find out about my job."
Yuri," In order to protect my job and my happiness,"
Yuri, I must make sure she never finds out about this!
Loid, Yuri Briar...
Loid, The Forgers' only blood relative.
Loid, It's easy to slip up around someone you'reemotionally close to. We must be careful.
Loid, I cannot lose this family that I've worked so hard to create.
Narrator, Everyone has a side they don't show anyone else.
Narrator," To their friends, their significant others, or even their families."
Yuri," Hello! It's nice to meet you! I'm Yor's younger brother, Yuri!"
Narrator," They hide what they're truly feeling through fake smiles or bravado,"
Narrator, and keep their true identities secret.
Loid and Yor, Welcome.
Narrator, That is how the world keeps up the appearance of its temporary peace.
Announcer," Foreign Minister Windsor met with Westalis's Foreign Minister Brantz for six days of talks,"
Announcer, with the goal of normalizing diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Loid, I'm going to find out...
Yuri, I'm going to find out...
Loid, if this man is going to harm our family or not!
Yuri, if this man is worthy of my sister or not!
Yuri," No, of course he's not worthy."
Loid," Oh, let me take your coat and the things you're carrying."
Yuri," Oh, no, there's no need. Thank you for offering."
Loid, I can prepare something simple for us to eat pretty quickly.
Loid, The two of you can go ahead and relax.
Yuri," Oh, don't mind me."
Yuri, I would never eat something you've made.
Yor," Oh, you look so scary, Yuri.You must be nervous."
Yuri, I-I'm not...
Yuri, Crap. My animosity must've been showing.
Yor," Please, make yourself at home."
Yuri, I could still be worked up from that interrogation earlier.
Yuri, I need to play the part of the studious civil servant in front of my sister!
Yor, I need to play the part of the lovely wife in front of Yuri!
Yor, I could never tell him that I got married so I could continue k*lling!
Yor," Thank you for the flowers, Yuri."
Yuri," Sure... But, Sis..."
Yuri, I haven't accepted your marriage yet.
Yuri, Why did you keep this a secret for a year?
Yuri, How am I supposed to accept it if you don't explain?
Loid, A reasonable question.
Loid," Now, then..."
Loid, About your brother... Why don't we just go ahead and tell him everything?
Loid, The fact that single women are seen as highly suspicious
Loid, is a very serious issue in our times.
Loid, I'm sure your brother will understand.
Yor, W-We can't!
Yor," My brother can be very, er, sensitive."
Yor," If he found out that I... I got married to someone I wasn't in love with,"
Yor, he would probably lose his composure.
Yor," Then we could end up troubling you, Loid..."
Yor, And I don't want my brother to have to worry about me over something like this.
Yor," Oh, b-but don't worry! I have the perfect excuse to give him!"
flashback Yor," I know more about Yuri than anyone else, so leave this to me!"
Loid," I'm counting on you, Yor."
Yuri," Well, Sis? Why didn't you tell me?"
Yor, W-Well...
Yor, B-Because I completely forgot!
Yuri," Huh? Okay, uh, I..."
Yor, It completely slipped my mind!
Yuri," Actually, when I called you the other day, you told me that you had a partner."
Yuri, You could've at least told me then!
Yor, W-Well...
Yor, I forgot that I had forgotten to tell you about my marriage!
Yuri," Well, if you say so, it must be true! Sorry, Sis."
Loid, He accepted that?!
Narrator," When it concerns his sister, this man's sense of logic goes out the window."
Yuri," Jeez, Sis! You're such a scatterbrain!"
Loid, Is this normal for the Briars?
Loid, Sorry to keep you waiting.
Yuri, Tch. How dare you interrupt the fun Sis and I were having?
Yuri," No... If I keep up this nasty attitude, Sis might end up hating me."
Yuri, I need to at least fake—
Yor, Isn't Loid's cooking just so delicious?
Yuri," Hmph! Don't think your cooking is enough to win me over, you villain!"
Yuri," Oh, right. I actually brought over some wine."
Yuri," Please, help yourselves."
Loid, How considerate of you.
Yuri, I'll get you drunk and expose you for the filthy villain you are!
Loid," None for you tonight, Yor."
Yor, I know.
Yor, Unfortunately.
Yuri, So where did you two meet?
Loid, At the boutique on rd Street.
Yor, It was so surprising for a man I didn't know to stare at me like that.
Loid," Er, well... She was just so beautiful, you know..."
Loid, The way you said that...
Loid, This subject will probably lead to a slip-up. I need to change it.
Loid," After a few dinners, we realized we had a lot in common."
Yuri, When were these dinners? Where? How many times did you go?
Yuri, Which restaurants?
Yuri, How many encounters led to your courtship?
Yuri, What made you decide to marry her?
Loid, Um...
Loid, Why do I feel like I'm being questioned by an officer?
Yuri, How do the two of you address each other?
Loid," Huh? Er, I call her ""Yor."""
Yuri," ""Yor""?!"
Yuri, Even I hesitate to use her given name!
Yuri," S-S-S-Sis, you don't happen to call him ""Loi Loi"" or ""Loidy,"" do you?"
Yor, Huh? Um...
Yuri, Loidy!
Yuri, God damn it!
Yor, I-I just... call him Loid!
Narrator," When it concerns his sister, this man's sense of logic... Well, you know the rest."
Loid, Are you all right?
Loid," Here, have some water."
Yuri, What could my sister possibly like about this guy?!
Yuri," Just because he can cook a little, and he's handsome, and tall,"
Yuri," and considerate, and a doctor, that's just..."
Yuri, That's just...
Yuri, God damn it!
Yor," Yuri, calm down."
Loid, I guess neither Briar holds their liquor well.
Loid," By the way, Yuri, I hear you're a diplomat."
Loid," Divert, divert..."
Loid, That's quite the line of work. Yor loves to brag about you all the time.
Yor, Dominic told me the other day that you went all the way to Hugaria recently.
Yuri," Huh? Yeah. I mean, it's just work."
Yuri, But yes. It was a beautiful city.
Yuri," I wish I could've shown you, Sis."
Yuri," There were a lot of cafés, too."
Yuri, There was even an old one that an empress used to frequent...
Loid," You mean in the capital city Obda, right?"
Loid, There are several delicious restaurants there.
Loid, I went there when I was a medical student.
Yuri," Oh, really?"
Yuri, I went to Kalpatia often.
Yuri, The old man who owns it makes a superb stew.
Loid," I had that, too! Ah..."
Loid, So this wine is also from Hugaria. It's excellent.
Loid, This is...
Yuri," Oh, that..."
Loid," ""I bought it from a shop on Hedger Street."""
Yuri, I found it at a little shop on Hedger Street.
Loid, It must've been pricey.
Loid, It's dalc.
Yuri," Oh, no. It was just around dalc."
Loid, I knew it.
Loid, That's plenty fancy. Thank you very much.
Loid, This conversation...
Loid, It's right out of the Ostanian Intelligence Agency's manual for the art of deception.
Loid, It's a conversation template used to fabricate a story about going to another country.
Loid, Meaning this whole story's been a lie.
Loid," Besides, the owner of Kalpatia now has his son running the shop."
Loid, And this wine actually costs dalc now due to a poor harvest.
Loid," You may be able to fool an amateur, but it won't work on me,"
Loid, Yuri Briar!
Loid, I had my reservations as soon as I heard you worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Loid, That line of work has commonly been an entryway to espionage.
Loid," I had Franky do some digging,"
Loid, and there are records showing he worked in that department up until a year ago.
Loid, He must've been scouted by the intelligence agency right before or after that.
Loid," Putting all the pieces together,"
Loid, this man works for the domestic counter-intelligence agency
Loid, that is WISE's mortal enemy... the secret police!
Loid," That said, though it may be dangerous,"
Loid," as long as he doesn't find out who I really am,"
Loid, maintaining this relationship isn't a bad idea.
Loid," If I play my cards right, he could be a powerful source of information"
Loid, regarding my enemies.
Loid, I'll get you something in return next time.
Yor," Isn't it wonderful that you have such a lovely older brother now, Yuri?"
Loid," He appears to be concealing his identity from Yor, too."
Loid, He may be easier to manipulate than I thought.
Yor, Yuri?
Yuri," I told you I wouldn't accept him, Sis!"
Yuri, I'm never going to call him my brother!
Yor," You're being rude, Yuri."
Yuri," Yeah, you're right."
Yuri," I went out into the world, made a name for myself,"
Yuri, and I can even buy expensive booze now!
Yuri, But that's all because of my sister!
Yuri," Our parents were gone, and we were poor,"
Yuri, so we couldn't even get everything I'd need for studying.
Yuri, But...
Young Yuri, Sis sure is late. She's still at her part-time job?
Young Yor," I'm home, Yuri!"
Young Yuri," Uh, Sis?!"
Young Yuri, What happened?! You're covered in blood!
Young Yuri, What kind of work were you doing?!
Young Yor," Huh? Oh, I'm totally fine."
flashback Young Yor," This isn't my blood, so..."
Young Yor," More importantly, look, Yuri!"
Young Yor, Ta-da! It's the encyclopedia set you wanted!
Young Yor," I got paid a lot this time, so I went ahead and bought it!"
Young Yuri, Sis...
flashbackYoung Yor," Ta-da! Here are those snacks you wanted, Yuri!"
Yor, Sis would always work herself to death for me!
flashbackYoung Yuri," You don't have to work anymore, Sis!"
Yuri," So I made up my mind... that I was going to become a proper adult,"
Yuri, and be a man who could protect my sister.
Yuri, I'm going to be the one who protects my one and only family member.
Yuri, Can you even imagine
Yuri, how it feels for me to have the most important person in my life
Yuri, just suddenly taken from me by some guy who appeared out of thin air?
Yor, Yuri...
Yuri," Sure, I wanted you to get married someday and find true happiness."
Yuri, But that guy has to be someone who could protect you even better than me!
Yuri," Are you saying you're up to that task,"
Yuri, Loidy?!
Loid, Lo—
Yor, I just want to put my brother's mind at ease.
Loid, I...
Loid," I love Yor as much as you do, if not more!"
Loid," My daughter loves Yor very much, too."
Yor, Come on... This is just an act to deceive my brother.
Loid, She is already a part of my family.
Loid," Even if spears or meteors rained down from the sky,"
Loid, I would risk my life to protect her.
Narrator, This man was a bold liar.
Yuri, Did he say... meteors?!
Yuri," I'm confident that I could protect her from spears, but meteors?!"
Yuri, Is he surprisingly powerful? But how would he do that?
Yuri," I-It's easy to claim such things, you liar!"
Yuri, Yeah! You have the face of a liar!
Yor," Oh, goodness."
Yor," You're so careless sometimes, Yuri!"
Loid internal, I have the face of a liar? Has he seen through me?
Loid," Oh, don't worry about it, Yor. I'll clean it up."
Loid internal," No, that couldn't be."
Yuri," What? You've been married for a year,"
Yuri, and that's your reaction when your hands touch?
Yuri, What? Are you actually married?
Loid, Wha—
Loid, Wh-What are you talking about?We're so in love.
Yor," Y-Yes, exactly."
Yuri," A likely story... If you're really married, then prove it to me."
Loid," I mean, we have our marriage license..."
Yuri, That's not what I meant!
Yuri, Kiss right here and now.
Yor and Loid, Huh?!
Yuri, Should be easy if you're actually in love.
Yor, Er... But if it's in front of someone...
Yuri, Just once is fine. Then I'll believe you.
Yuri," If you can't, I'm going to city hall to have them revoke your marriage license!"
Loid, This is bad. What should I do?
Loid," No, calm down."
Loid," I'm Westalis's greatest spy, Twilight."
Loid, I've had relations with countless women on my missions.
Loid, If a kiss or two will keep my mission safe...
Loid, If that's all it takes...
Yor, What?!
Yor," Loid, wait..."
Loid," I'm just going to do what I always do, Yor."
Loid, Come on.
Yor," I mean, we need to so we can keep our fake marriage going, but..."
Yor, Wha...
Yor, Wha...
Yor, What?!
Sign, SHOW OFF HOW IN LOVE YOU ARE
Yuri," If you're really married, then prove it to me."
Yuri, Kiss right here and now.
Loid, If that's all it takes...
Yor, What?!
Yor, A kiss? A kiss?!
Yor, Doesn't that mean... um...
Yor," Oh, yes. I've read somewhere that your first kiss tastes like lemons."
Yor, That'll go perfectly with this marinated fish.
Yor," Calm down, Yor! Get a hold of yourself!"
Loid, Here I go.
Yor," O-O-O-One second, please."
Yor, There is no way I can do this sober.
Yor, Fank you for waiting...
Loid, Uh... right.
Loid, We don't have to do this if you don't want to.
Yor," This ish for my sake, as well. I will do my besht."
Yuri, What are you two whispering about?!
Yuri, Can you do it or not?!
Yuri, Prove to me that you're really a married couple!
Yor," Keep your mouf shut, Yuri."
Yor, We will now show you just how in wuv we are.
Yor," Here I come, darling."
Yor," Now, cwose your eyes."
Yuri, S-Sis!
Loid, Um... Yor?
Sign, SHOW OFF HOW IN LOVE YOU ARE
Yor, Sis...
Yuri, How lewd!
Little Yuri, Sis!
Little Yuri, Look! I scored the highest in my whole class!
Yor," Oh, how wonderful!"
Yor, I'll reward you with a kiss.
Yor, Smooch!
Little Yuri, Sis...
Little Yuri, When I grow up...
Little Yuri, I'm gonna marry you.
Yor," Oh, my."
Yor, Then I guess I'll just have to wait patiently for you.
Yuri, You...
Yuri," You can't, Sis!"
Yuri, Seeing you kiss another man in front of me is just...
Yuri, I won't allow—
Yor," Oh, I knew it..."
Yor, I just can't!
Yuri, —itpppppbt!
Yor, No!
Anya, Izzit the end of the world?
Yor," Huh?! Um, Yuri?"
Yuri," I see how it is, Sis."
Yuri, You're going to treat me like that just because I tried to stop you from kissing him.
Yuri, I guess you just couldn't wait to do naughty things with him!
Yuri, I was a fool to test you.
Yuri, Perhaps my feelings were what was truly being tested here!
Loid," Um... more importantly, you're bleeding."
Yuri, Loid Forger... You may lay claim on my sister's lips for now.
Yor, Wha—
Yor, What are you talking about?!
Yuri," Right... Well, I'll let you off the hook for today."
Yuri, But just remember—
Loid," No, really. You're bleeding."
Loid, Is this just normal for the Briars?
Yor," Are you all right, Yuri? You're about to fall over."
Yuri, I'm fine.
Loid, Did you really just say that?
Yuri," Well, so are you, Sis."
Yor, Shall I call you a taxi?
Yuri," I'm fine. You're such a worrywart, Sis."
Loid," Whoa, there!"
Yuri, Wipe that smirk off your face!
Yuri, Are my failures that amusing to you?!
Loid," Er, no. I was just admiring what lovely siblings you are."
Loid, You must have always been there for each other.
Loid," Yuri, thank you for protecting Yor up until now."
Loid, I'm sure you've been through many hardships.
Loid," I'll also do everything I can to be there for her from now on,"
Loid, so let's do everything we can to make sure Yor is happy.
Yuri, Like I'd ever ask for your help!
Yuri, Forget it! I'm going home!
Loid, Feel free to come over anytime!
Loid, I'm sure that'll make Yor happy.
Loid, You should come when my daughter's awake next time.
Yor, Miss Anya was doing everything she could to stay up to meet you.
Yor," She's absolutely precious, so I hope you'll play with her."
Yuri, I don't need him to invite me! I'll be back!
Yuri," Next time, I'll prove that you're tricking my sister!"
Yor, I am not being tricked!
Yuri," Now, hear me, Loid Forger."
Yuri," If you make my sister cry even a little bit,"
Yuri, I will have you ex—
Yuri," Um... well, you know."
Yuri, Just know that you'll rue the day!
Yor," Be careful getting home, dear!"
Yuri, Sis!
Yor, Be mindful of your yelling! It'll disturb the neighbors!
Loid, Was he about to say he'd have me ex*cuted?
Loid, I should be careful.
Loid, Any wiretaps?
Loid, Looks like we're clear.
Loid, Since he's with the secret police...
Loid," Well, because he's her brother, he may just try that."
Loid, I need to be on my guard.
Yor," Loid, thank you very much."
Yor," I'm a bit embarrassed to say so,"
Yor," but thank you for welcoming him into your family, despite his rudeness."
Loid," Yuri clearly loves you very much, Yor."
Loid," I don't have any family or friends I can rely on, other than my daughter,"
Loid, so I admit that I was a little envious of you two.
Yor, Loid...
Loid, Though my daughter is also just part of a pretend family.
Loid," Well, anyway. I'm glad he didn't find out about our pretend marriage."
Yor, Yes.
Yor," I'm suddenly very tired, now that I'm relieved."
Yor, Why don't we head to bed after we clean up?
Loid," Er, in separate beds, of course! I'll change things back!"
Yor, R-Right.
Anya, Papa... Pwease save Earth...
Yor," Now, Yuri... You'll make me mad if you hit Loid..."
Loid, I can't remember the last time I felt envious of another.
Loid, I should sleep. I'm sure I'm just exhausted.
Loid, Yet my mission still continues on tomorrow.
Yuri, I beg your pardon.
Yuri, Which way is the station?
B," Get to the hospital first, pal!"
Anya," Morning, pwease."
Anya," You seem very green today, Papa."
Loid, Quit talking in your sleep and go wash your face.
Yor, Good morning!
Yor, It's too bad you didn't get to meet Yuri yesterday.
Anya, Who's that?
Yor, Huh?! But she was so looking forward to meeting him!
Loid, Things sure did get lively yesterday.
Yor, I'm very sorry.
Loid, Who'd have thought Yor's brother would be like that?
Anya, Oh! Unkie!
Loid," And he's part of the secret police, my greatest foe as a spy."
Anya, S-Secret police?!
Anya, What's that?
Anya," ""Secret"" plus ""police""..."
Anya, That sounds so exciting!
Anya, Why didn't you introduce me to him?!
Anya, Gimme back the excitement I wasted!
Loid, You wanted to meet him that badly?
Loid," Well, at least the storm has passed for now."
Loid, I need to concentrate on Anya's education.
Loid," Come on, hurry up and eat. You'll be late."
Anya, Om... nom...
Yor," Don't worry, you'll see be able to see him soon."
Loid, Has the thr*at truly passed?
Loid," Yor Briar, whose younger brother is a member of the secret police..."
Loid," Previously, there was nothing suspicious surrounding her."
Loid," She didn't seem to know what her brother's true occupation is,"
Loid, so my intuition says she's still clear.
Loid," Besides, if she knew her brother worked at the State Security Service,"
Loid, there'd be no concern over suspicions arising about her being single.
Loid," No, it's dangerous to be too certain."
Loid, What if she was just acting and this was all a lie to get closer to me?
Loid," Suspect everything, Twilight."
Anya," Papa, Mama is..."
Loid, What is it?
Anya, Mama is...
Anya, bad at cooking.
Yor, So it was obvious that I made breakfast this morning!
Yor, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
Yor, I did do my best.
Loid," Ah, by the way, Yor..."
Yor, Yes?
Loid," Er, I just..."
Loid, I guess putting a listening device on her is going too far.
Loid," No, I need to silence any doubts now."
Loid, Even a moment's carelessness could mean death.
Loid, It could also mean the lives of tens of thousands of people.
Loid, I need to do this to prove Yor's innocence.
Loid, You've got something on your neck.
Yor, Huh? Thank you very much.
Yor, That startled me. I thought he was going to give me a kiss goodbye.
Anya, Wha?!
Yor, I s-still haven't forgotten about last night...
Yor, I can't kiss or even cook.
Yor," Loid managed to smooth things over last night,"
Yor, but I'm probably not acting like a proper wife.
Yor," I may be imagining it, but Loid seems a bit more distant today."
Yor, Maybe he's gotten sick of me being so disappointing.
Loid, I need to be on my guard.
Loid," What's the matter, Anya?"
Anya, Mama and Papa need to get along.
Loid," W-Well, we aren't fighting or anything."
Yor, Th-That's right.
Loid, And you make sure you get along with your classmates.
Anya, Yep.
Loid," We should get going, too."
Yor," Oh, right."
Loid, Children are so curiously observant at times.
First Lieutenant," Hey, Yuri."
First Lieutenant, Why are you covered in bandages?
First Lieutenant, Didn't you go celebrate your sister's wedding yesterday?
Yuri, I don't really remember what happened.
First Lieutenant, You probably got drunk and picked a fight with her husband.
First Lieutenant, You really need to quit drinking.
Yuri," Well, I can't let a guy like that be with my sister."
First Lieutenant, Was he that disagreeable?
Yuri, I think...
Yuri, he was...
Yuri, a good guy.
Yuri, But con men and spies always try to act like good people.
Yuri, That's it! Hopefully he's a spy! Then I can throw him in a cell!
First Lieutenant, Calm down. Do you have any proof of this?
Yuri, sh*t!
Yuri, I totally forgot to bug their living room and bedrooms!
Yuri," Wait, no!"
Yuri," If I happened to hear Sis's voice in those situations,"
Yuri, my heart wouldn't be able to bear it!
First Lieutenant, Did you give yourself those injuries?
First Lieutenant, You need to detach from your sister so you can concentrate on your work more.
First Lieutenant, Our job is to capture
First Lieutenant," spies from the West, namely, Twilight."
First Lieutenant, Because that will lead to your sister's safety.
Yuri, I know that. For now...
Yuri," Loid Forger, the day you make my sister cry..."
Camilla, What's with her?
Millie," She said something like, ""I'm a failure of a wife."""
Sharon, Heya.
Millie," Oh, Sharon."
Sharon, Huh? How do you become a good wife?
Sharon, Are you two not getting along?
Yor," Well, it's not exactly that..."
Yor," It's just... This is my first time being with a man in general,"
Yor," It's just... This is my first time being with a man in general,"
Yor, so I'm unsure of how to act.
Loid," I was curious when I looked into her past connections,"
Loid, but I guess Yor has really never dated a man before.
Yor, I'm worried that things can't go on like this.
Yor, It doesn't help that I can't cook.
Loid, Anya's words really got to her.
Loid, It appears that Yor is trying to seem more wifely for the sake of our pretend family.
Loid," No, wait."
Loid, She could also be trying to act like the perfect wife to put one over on me.
Camilla, It must be rough when your husband is clearly so much better than you.
Millie, Why don't you two just call it quits?
Yor," Er, I'd like to avoid that."
Loid," Yor's relationship with her coworkers seems a bit, er, uh..."
Section Chief," Hey, you four!"
Section Chief," Hey, you four!"
Section chief, Quit yapping and get to work.
Camilla, Gah! It's the section chief.
Section Chief," Say, Yor..."
Section Chief, Could you go drop this off at the post office for me?
Yor," Yes, sir."
Loid, I guess I'll have to make a move if I want to clear the air for good.
Yor," Come to think of it, Loid and I have separate bank accounts."
Yor," If I contributed a bit of my earnings from my actual job,"
Yor, would I be able to help Loid out?
Yor," But I can't make him suspicious of me, either."
Yor," Not to mention, I don't think this was really a financial issue..."
Fake Lieutenant, You there. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Fake lieutenant, May we have a bit of your time?
Yor, Th-The secret police!
Yor," D-Did I do something wrong, sir?"
Yor," Was I being far too suspicious by looking at ads meant for families,"
Yor, when I'm clearly lacking as a wife?
Yor, I-I-I'm married!
Fake Second Lieutenant, We're not hitting on you.
Franky, What the hell is this?!
Franky, You call me outta nowhere and tell me to dress like this
Franky, so we can question your wife?!
Loid, Just shut up and follow the plan. This is all for my mission.
Franky, I've got nothing to do with that!
Fake lieutenant, We are inspecting the mail.
Fake lieutenant, You just tried to mail this...
Fake lieutenant, But it clearly contains a code meant for the West.
Fake Lieutenant," Is the sender, Burns, your superior?"
Yor, Y-Yes.
Fake second lieutenant, What is your name?
Yor, Yor Bri—
Yor, I-It's Yor Forger.
Fake second lieutenant," Well, well, well... Yor Forger, eh?"
Fake second lieutenant, It clearly states your name right here as a collaborator!
Fake Lieutenant, So you're in cahoots.
Yor, I-I have no idea about this. This must be some kind of mistake.
Fake Second Lieutenant, You'd be better off if you told the truth.
Fake Lieutenant," Speaking of city hall, someone from the finance department was caught the other day."
Fake lieutenant," Clearly, the corruption within has spread far and wide."
Fake second Lieutenant, I heard he met a pitiful end.
Fake second lieutenant," The intense t*rture got to him physically and mentally,"
Fake second lieutenant, and he apparently offed himself in his cell.
Fake second lieutenant," And I heard last month, they caught another woman around this chick's age."
Fake second lieutenant," You know, that official's secretary."
Fake lieutenant," Ah, her."
Fake lieutenant, She was freed once we found out she had family in State Security Service.
Fake second lieutenant," Man, talk about an awesome benefit."
Fake second lieutenant, Our family members can be let off the hook of most allegations.
Fake lieutenant, Enough talking. You'll be coming with us to the station.
Loid," If she's aware that Yuri works for the State Security Service,"
Loid, this will all be solved as soon as she mentions Yuri's name.
Loid," There's no reason for her to be secretive to one of his coworkers,"
Loid," and if she resists, she'll further make us suspicious."
Loid," Come on, Yor. If you're in on this, ask your brother for help."
Loid, And if you're not...
Yor, I...
Yor, work hard every day for the citizens of this country.
Yor, I would never participate in espionage!
Fake second lieutenant, No use playing dumb with us!
Fake second lieutenant, Just shut up and come with—
Fake second lieutenant," Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
Yor, I'm quite certain I mentioned that I was married.
Yor, Please do not touch me so casually.
Fake lieutenant," You do realize you're putting your family in danger by doing this, don't you?"
Yor, My younger brother and husband are both kind
Yor, and upstanding members of society.
Yor," If you ever unjustly harm either of them,"
Yor, I frankly do not care if I'm dealing with you two.
Yor, I will show no mercy!
Fake Lieutenant," Hey, Second Lieutenant Mop..."
Fake lieutenant, Are you certain about this cipher?
Fake second lieutenant, What? Of course I'm—
Fake second lieutenant, What the?!
Fake second lieutenant," Looking closer, this is clearly not the raccoon cipher."
Fake second lieutenant, It's the caterpillar cipher!
Fake lieutenant, If we decode this message...
Fake lieutenant, This is a letter Burns sent to a renowned hemorrhoids doctor.
Yor, Huh?
Fake lieutenant, I see. He used a cipher because he was embarrassed.
Fake lieutenant, How confusing.
Fake lieutenant," So, yes, it would appear we had the wrong idea."
Fake lieutenant, Your name isn't on here at all.
Fake lieutenant," You may leave, but make sure you keep quiet about this for Mr. Burns's sake, too."
Franky," Well, that was quite the farce."
Franky," Considering how she acted, it's pretty clear she has no connections with the secret police."
Franky," Hey, come on. Don't tell me you feel guilty for doubting her."
Loid, I don't.
Franky," I've warned you about this before, but don't develop unnecessary feelings for her."
Franky," If you value your life, don't trust anyone."
Franky, We have no other way to survive.
Loid," Somehow, it's extremely infuriating to hear those words from that face."
Franky, But you made that face!
Franky, Damn it! I thought I could land a few chicks with that face on.
Franky, My precious hot-guy face!
Loid, It's a terrible idea to date a woman while deceiving her.
Franky, Did you really just say that?
Yor, Today was terribly nerve-wracking.
Yor," I was almost arrested, meaning not only would I be ruined as a wife,"
Yor, but I would've destroyed the Forgers.
Loid," Oh, hello, Yor."
Yor, Loid...
Loid, What a coincidence. Why don't we go home together?
Loid," Oh? There's something on your collar again, Yor."
Yor, I'm so sorry.
Yor," Apparently, I'm such a failure as wife that I can't even keep up proper appearances."
Loid," Well, if you ask me, Yor..."
Loid," Perhaps many families throughout this world are somehow putting on an act,"
Loid," thinking, ""A wife should be like this,"" or, ""You're supposed to be the parent."""
Loid," Of course, I believe that working hard to be your best self is admirable."
Loid," But if you dwell on that so much that you lose yourself,"
Loid, things that should go well might fall apart.
Loid, Many people suffering like that come to my hospital all the time.
Loid, Putting on an act all the time can become tiring.
Yor, Loid...
Loid," And that's why I want you to be as you are, Yor."
Loid," The more confident you seem, the less people will suspect anything."
Loid, And I'm sure Anya will be happier seeing you smile.
Yor, Thank you very much. I...
Yor," I'm truly grateful that I married you, Loid!"
flashback Franky, Don't tell me you feel guilty for doubting her.
Yor, What did you just throw away?
Loid," Oh, just the lint I found on your collar earlier."
Loid," More importantly,"
Loid, we didn't even do anything to celebrate our one-year wedding anniversary.
Loid, Why don't we buy some cake on our way home?
Yor, That's a lovely idea!
Anya," Papa, Mama! I have returned!"
Yor," Welcome home, Miss Anya."
Loid, What's the matter?
Anya, Papa and Mama are getting along!
Loid, I told you that we were never fighting to begin with.
Yor," We have cake, Miss Anya!"
Anya, I want some cake!
Loid," Hey, now. You're going to bother the people downstairs."

Henderson," Good morning, sir."
Henderson," Would you like some tea, as well?"
Instructor," Yes, I'd love some."
Instructor, It's been a while since you were in charge of the grade school kids.
Instructor, How are the kids this year?
Henderson," I must say, they show promise."
Instructor, I heard you had to give one of them a Tonitrus Bolt on their first day.
Henderson," True, it was a rather rare occurrence for our prestigious Eden College."
Instructor," It's the first time I've heard of it happening, too."
Henderson, I only did what was necessary.
Henderson," Good deeds shall be praised,"
Henderson, and misconduct will be met with punishment.
Henderson, That is essential to education.
Instructor," I have much to learn from you, sir."
Henderson, As the elementary students pass through the gates of Eden College
Henderson," to learn true elegance every day, our school's traditions shall live on."
Henderson, Our house of learning exists to ensure the future of our country is elegant.
Ewen, Lord Damian!
Ewen," Isn't this your older brother, Lord Damian?"
Damian, Yes...
Ewen, This must be his entrance ceremony!
Ewen," He's probably elsewhere in this book, too!"
Emile," Oh, there he is!"
Ewen, Ooh!
Emile, There he is again!
Ewen, And here! He's truly an MVP!
Emile, Your brother is just raking in the Stellas! How magnificent!
Ewen," But I'm sure you'll become an Imperial Scholar even faster, Lord Damian!"
Ewen, We all know you'll be the first to get a Stella in our grade!
Damian," W-Well, yes."
Emile, But we still have a while until our exams.
Emile, Your first opportunity will be...
Emile, Our P.E. class next week.
Emile, We'll be having a dodgeball tournament with the other classes!
Ewen, My friend told me something he heard from his friend in Class .
Ewen," He said if you become MVP, you can get a Stella!"
Damian, Really?
Emile," This is your chance, Lord Damian!"
Damian," MVP, eh?"
Henderson," It is a clear, sunny day."
Henderson," Young ladies and gentlemen of Eden,"
Henderson, you will be adding another page to Eden's history today...
Henderson, Elegantly and brilliantly.
Damian, Shut up! You picked a fight with me first!
Anya, Anya didn't do anything wrong!
Becky," Exactly! First off, you—"
Damian," Shut up, uggo!"
Becky, Excuse me?!
Anya, Shithead.
Damian," Shut it, Stubby Legs!"
Becky, You're not supposed to talk to girls like that!
Henderson, Ele...gant.
Anya, I have returned!
Yor," Welcome home, Miss Anya."
Anya," Papa, I have acquired important news!"
Loid, What?
Loid, You may be able to get a Stella at your next P.E. class?
Anya, That's what Becky said.
Becky, My friend told me something she heard from her friend in Class .
Becky, The MVP from the winning class in next week's tournament
Becky, will receive a Stella!
Loid, So it's a rumor? That seems dubious.
Yor," Then we need to train, Miss Anya!"
Anya, Training!
Yor, So what sport will you be playing?
Anya, Dodgeball.
Yor, Dodgeball...
Yor," That's the game where you hit your opponent with a ball to do them in, right?"
Loid," ""Do them in""?"
Anya, Mama! Teach me a k*ller move!
Yor, Very well! I shall teach you the ultimate k*ller move with a ball.
Loid," Are you also athletic, Yor?"
Yor," Oh, not exactly."
Yor, I just used to play catch with my brother sometimes.
Yor, I can't tell them I rip people apart and toss them around on a daily basis!
Yor," Just leave this to me, Miss Anya!"
Yor, I'll show you a k*ller move that will help you catch that star!
Anya, I will reach for the stars in dodgeball!
Anya, Anya will catch the star!
Yor, That's the spirit!
Loid, I'm glad she's so motivated... but...
Anya, Super Anya will catch the star!
Yor, Yes!
Yor, We'll start with strength training.
Yor, One...
Yor, Two...
Yor, Three...
Yor, Four...
Yor, Five.
Yor, Six.
Yor," Stamina is crucial, too."
Yor, Miss Anya!
Yor," Now, listen carefully."
Yor, You're not just using your arms when you throw the ball.
Yor," You need to make sure you step out with your foot,"
Yor," twist your hips as you shift your weight,"
Yor," channel all of your strength into your shoulder, and... throw!"
Yor, Okay! Now you give it a try!
Yor," Oh, Loid."

Loid, This is training?

Anya, I even thought up a name for my k*ller sh*t.
Anya, I'm gonna seize that star!
Anya, I'm gonna get lots of stars...
Anya, so I can help Papa with his mission!
Emile, At least it's clear that you're motivated.
Ewen," Just make sure you don't hold Lord Damian back, Stubby Legs."
Anya, Second son... and his lackeys.
Becky, Why are we playing together with the boys?
Becky, Being on the same team with him is the worst.
Anya, Second son... The son of Papa's target for this mission.
Anya, Good things happen if I become friends with him.
Damian, Wh-What are you staring at?!
Anya," But he gets really mean, so I don't like him."
Damian," Well, I don't have any time to waste on a runt like you, either."
Anya, A runt?
Damian, I'm going to get MVP in this tournament and be rewarded a Stella.
Damian, I need to become an Imperial Scholar just like my brother.
Damian, Otherwise...
Damian, Father will never notice me.
Ewen," Hey, wait, Lord Damian!"
Henderson, Gather round!
Henderson," Your usual P.E. teacher, Bobby, is out sick, so I will be his substitute."

Emile, he won awards in all kinds of sports tournaments in kindergarten.
Emile, The Monster of Bodam!
Becky, Are there even that many tournaments in kindergarten?!
Damian," Wearing glasses right now is dangerous, old man."
Bill," I humbly thank you for your concern, Damian, son of Chairman Desmond."
Bill," But I'll be fine, because that ball won't be hitting me."
Bill, Also...
Bill, Any hits above the shoulders don't count.
Bill, Enemy positions confirmed.

Class mob, Gerf.
Class mob, Gah.
Henderson, Four hits.
Class mob," Wow! Way to go, Bill!"
Emile, What?!
Ewen, Is that even possible?!
Damian, Don't panic! That was just a fluke!
Bill," Oh, that wasn't a fluke."
Bill, When I throw the ball...
Bill, Every imaginable detail has been calculated.
Bill, We're not just talking simulations. I've trained my body to its limit.
Bill, Daddy!
s Father," Ah, my son, Bill."
Bill," Yes, Daddy?"
s Father," You will eventually be the hero of Eden, as well as our army."
s Father, Make sure you seize those Stellas with your own hands.
s Father, For the future of Ostania!
Bill," Sir, yes, sir!"
Bill, Yes... my victory is predetermined.
Becky," Um, hello?! We'll die if that actually hits us!"
Bill, Don't worry. I'll hold back on you women.
Becky," Actually, that also pisses me off."
Becky, Gurk!
Henderson, Hit.
Damian, That's some mouth you've got on you.
Damian," Do you really think we went into this without a plan, you giant oaf?"
Damian, You can't win...
Damian, at dodgeball all by yourself!
Emile, Ow!
Emile, You're gonna be the MVP! I just know it!
Damian, I'm gonna be the MVP!
Damian, Let's do this! Formation G!
Emile and Ewen, Right!
Henderson, Four hits.
Damian, I'm not done yet!
Emile, Ultimate...
Ewen, ...Shadow...
Damian, ...Clone...
 Ewen, ...att*ck!
Bill," Shadow clone, eh?"
Bill," Now, this is what you call..."
Bill, a real shadow clone att*ck!

Emile, Ewen... you dummy. Don't cry.
Ewen, I'm not crying!
Emile, It's not the end yet...
Emile, So don't give up hope.
Ewen, Yeah. I know. I know!
Ewen," Once we give up, it's game over—"
Damian," Damn it! At this rate, we're gonna lose."
Damian, I need to find his weakness!
Damian, I don't care if the others go down.
Damian, I need to somehow survive and stand out!
Anya, Second son is a real shithead.
Bill, Next up...
Bill, we have that little runt over there.
Bill, I'm going to aim for... her feet!
Bill, Wha—
Damian, Hey! He missed! Nice!
Out of Bounds Class Student A, Let's get the ball going!
Bill, She just...
Bill, jumped before I threw the ball!
Out of bounds class student B, Take this!
Bill, In that case...
Bill, I'll aim for her right arm!
Bill," Okay, her left!"
Bill, I guess I'll just have to use my secret w*apon!
Bill, This throw will suddenly change its course and nail any opponent scampering about!
Bill, Take this!
Bill, Homing Slider sh*t!
Becky, What was that about holding back on women?!
Class student, Blorf!
Class student, Blorf!
Henderson, Hit.
Bill, That's impossible! She's reading my every att*ck!
Bill, Who in the world is that girl?!
Damian," Hey, not bad..."
Anya, Heh.
Henderson," ""Dodgeball,"" of course, stems from ""dodge,"""
Henderson, meaning to swiftly move out of the way.

Becky, Anya! Look out for the guys out of bounds!
Damian," You dummy! Get up, quick!"
Bill," You were impressive, but even you can't dodge from that position!"
Bill, Die!
Damian, The bastard just threw that ball with everything he has!
Damian," It's unfortunate... But in the end, this is her own fault."
Damian, Don't worry. I shall survive and lead Class to victory.
Henderson, Hit.
Ewen," Wh-What are you doing, Lord Damian?!"
Damian," Oh, no! My chance at MVP!"
Anya, You protected me?
Damian, Huh?
Anya, Are you a good guy?
Damian, N-N-No!
Damian," I was just frustrated that he was taking out our team left and right,"
Damian, so I tried to catch it...
Damian, Damn it all!
Damian, You're the only one left. It's in your hands now.
Anya, The future is in Anya's hands.
Anya, Now is the time to unleash my k*ller sh*t!
Yor," Miss Anya, this is my final lesson for you."
Yor, The key to throwing a ball well is to put your whole body into the throw.
Yor, Think of this ball as an arrow of light!
Anya," I won't let your death go to waste, second son."
Damian, I'm not dead!
Anya, I will avenge you!
Damian, That power she had when she knocked me out...
Damian, She might just be able to...
Becky," I have no idea what's going on, but this is intense."
Becky, Could it be...
Anya, The most important thing is shifting my weight.
Anya, The power in my stepand the twisting of my hips
Anya, need to go to my widdle hands...
Anya, And then my widdle hands... um... um...
Anya, Anyway!
Anya, k*ller sh*t!
Anya, Star Catch Arrow!
Bill, Huh? What?
Bill, Huh?!
Henderson, That's game.
Becky, Huh?
Class students, Yay! We won!
 Emile, Huh?
Class students," Now you're definitely getting that Stella, Bill!"
Henderson, Hm? Stella?
Henderson, There are no Stella awarded for winning a mere mini-game in a single class.
Henderson, Who in the world suggested otherwise?
Henderson," On the other hand, you had the nerve to yell something as vile as ""die"" during the match,"
Henderson, so I have no issue with giving you a Tonitrus Bolt instead.
Class students," Don't worry, Bill! We'll just try harder next time!"
Class students, We'll have another chance.
Henderson, But to think...
Henderson, Two students who were at odds with each other worked together to take on this challenge.
Becky," Too bad, Anya. But you did great!"
Henderson," This shows that you are worthy of a Stella, young ladies and gentlemen."
Becky, Cheer up!
Damian," You can't be serious, you moron! What was that crappy throw?!"
Damian, I shouldn't have defended you!
Anya, Shock!
Becky, What's your problem? It's not like you hit anyone!
Anya, Anya doesn't like you after all.
Damian," What did you say, Stubby Legs?!"
Becky, You're not supposed to say stuff like that to girls!
Henderson, Or perhaps not.
Anya, You really are a shithead.
Damian, Huh?! Say that again!
Anya, Everything Mama teaches me is useless.

Bondman," I can't believe this! Hey, hey! Wake up!"
Loid," Hey, Anya."
Anya, Anya is busy right now.
Bondman, This is just awful.
Anya, No! I don't wanna study!
Loid," Now, hold on."
Loid, We made a deal. You agreed to start studying at PM.
Anya, You demon! Papa is a demon!
Loid," Operation Strix, Phase ..."
Loid," In order to attend the target's social gathering,"
Loid, I need to make sure my daughter Anya becomes an Imperial Scholar.
Loid," For her to achieve that, she will need to get good grades"
Loid, and receive Stellas.
Loid, How many times do I have to tell you?
Loid," That's supposed to be an ""E,"" not an ""A."""
Yor," B-But, Loid-san, her math score here is pretty good."
Yor," Well done, Anya-san."
Anya, He has two-eighths of his b*ll*ts left!
Loid, Is this because of her cartoon?
Loid," Oh, that's right."
Loid, This proverb is the same one Bondman was saying in episode .
Anya, I forgot...
Loid," Well, remember!"

Sign, Good at: ??
Anya, trying to figure out which classmate is good at what subject.
Anya," And then I will definitely get perfect scores,"
Anya, no problem.
Anya, I tried sounding like Papa.
Loid, It would be easy to make her every score an A+ by using backdoor methods.
Loid," But if she suddenly scores that high,"
Loid, the school and those around her will become suspicious.
Loid," In order to make this all seem as natural as possible,"
Loid, I need to nurture her basic knowledge.
Loid," If she ends up being shunned by her classmates, it may affect her life at school."
Loid, I can't have her not wanting to go to school.
Anya," If I read everyone's minds to get s, they'll all hate me?"
Adult A," Hey, how do you even know that?"
Adult B, You creepy little witch!
Loid, I guess forcing her to study too much might be a bit rough on her.
Loid," If her motivation remains low, her concentration won't improve,"
Loid, so she'll have a lesser chance of learning.
Loid, A change of pace is also important.
Loid, There are ways of earning Stella besides academics.
Loid," Right, then."
Loid, Why don't we take a break from studying and draw?
Loid," For example, art."
Loid," Hey, that looks really cool!"
Loid," Is it a cheetah? No, wait..."
Loid, I bet it's a panda!
Anya, It's a moo cow. The one that was at school.
Loid," For example, music!"
Loid, This is a violin for children.
Loid, There's always sports!
Anya, Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Loid," Come on, don't cry."
Loid," Stay calm, Twilight."
Loid, A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Loid, She's still in first grade.
Loid, I need to figure out what she has a talent for and help her excel in it.
Yor, Why don't we do some jump rope?
Yor, It's a lot of fun.
Loid, Right. Don't panic.
Loid, It's not like Desmond is immediately going to make his move.
Loid, It takes an incredible amount of time to begin a w*r.
Loid, But...
Handler, HQ was estimating that she'd be able to receive eight Stella in about four months.
Loid, Do we actually have that much time?
Anya, Papa...
Anya, Anya will do her best.
Anya, Now untie me.
Loid," Uh, right."
Loid, Anya.
Loid, Why don't we go out tomorrow?
Anya, An ooting?
Loid," Academics, the arts, sports..."
Loid, But there is actually one other way to earn Stella.
Loid, Community service.
Head Nurse, Thank you so much for agreeing to volunteer at our hospital today.
Head Nurse, I will now go over the duties we'll be asking you to perform.
Head nurse, We will have you split up into your families to perform your duties.
Loid," In the past, there have been many cases where students"
Loid, did long-term volunteer work to earn their Stella.
Loid, Rescuing others or helping apprehend criminals
Loid," were also methods a few used to earn Stella, but rare."
Loid," We could use more personnel from HQ to act out these scenarios,"
Loid," but considering the risks that could entail, we won't be able to easily pull that off."
Head nurse, That is what we will be expecting from all of you.
Loid," Even if she isn't immediately able to receive any Stella,"
Loid, it would be beneficial to Anya to learn the importance of community service.
Head nurse," Now, if I can have the Forgers clean this dressing room."
Anya, There's a pool!
Loid," Yes, for physical therapy."
Head nurse, Maybe cleaning was a bit difficult for you.
Head nurse, Then let's have you organize books in the library.
Nurse A," Excuse me, sir, could you do something about... that?"
Nurse A, Could you go work somewhere else?
Anya, Anya is bored with chores.
Anya, I wanna do the job where I give the doctors their scalpels.
Loid, Huh?
Anya, I'mma go to the operating room!
Loid, Hey! Stop that! Come back here!
Head nurse," We've had enough of your ""help""! Please leave!"
Anya," Papa, I'm sorry."
Loid, Don't worry about it. Everyone fails sometimes.
Loid, But what do we do if our chances of earning Stella through community service also dry up?
Ken," Hey, is physical therapy hard?"
Female swim instructor," It is,"
Female swim instructor, but you need to work hard so that you can run again.
Ken, Man...
Male swim instructor, Three more minutes.
Ken," Hey, is the water in the pool cold?"
Female swim instructor," Don't worry about that. Go on, get changed."
Female swim instructor," I'll go get changed, too."
Male swim instructor," All right, one, two. One, two. One, two."
Ken, I wonder if that's the adult pool...
Male swim instructor, Focus on your toes.
Male swim instructor," One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two."
Ken, Man... it really is kinda cold.
Male swim instructor," You're almost there! One, two. One, two."
Female swim instructor, Ken?
Female swim instructor, Huh? Is he still changing?
Loid, Hmm... I might have to ask HQ to reconsider our game plan.
Ken, C-Can't... breathe...
Ken, My legs... won't move...
Anya, The pool!
Anya, Papa!
Loid," What is it? You just went to the bathroom, didn't you?"
Anya, Someone's drowning in the pool!
Loid, What?! How do you know that?
Loid, Exactly who are you?!
Ken, Help me... Help me...
Anya, Papa...
Anya, Anya is terrible at volunteering.
Anya, So I...
Anya," I'm gonna become a pro swimmer and get stars,"
Anya, so I'm gonna go practice in the pool!
Loid, What?! Come back here! That's not a public pool!
Female swim instructor, Ken!
Female swim instructor, He must've snuck out.
Female swim instructor, Hey!
Female swim instructor, Where are your parents?
Anya, Wow! The pool! How fun!
Patient A, What's that about?
Anya, Where is the drowning person?
Ken, I'm...
Ken, I'm... gonna die...
Female swim instructor," What are you doing, little girl?!"
Anya, Anya... can't... anymore...
Loid," Hey, are you two all right?"
Female swim instructor, Ken!
Anya, Papa...
Female swim instructor, Someone get a doctor!
Anya, I tried to swim and found this boy sinking.
Female swim instructor, Ken!
Female swim instructor, Are you all right?
Female swim instructor, Ken!
Loid," Calm down, miss."
Male swim instructor, Is everything okay?
Female swim instructor, Ken! Ken!
Patient A, But there were so many people around.
Patient B, Did you hear anything?
Female swim instructor, I'm so sorry! I had no idea you were drowning!
Loid, It was a drowning response.
Loid, Children tend to drown more quietly than you would expect.
Loid, Many die because no one notices they're drowning.
Loid, Please make sure you keep your eye on him.
Loid, And good job for noticing.
Anya, I saw bubbles.
Loid," And you should be careful, too."
Female swim instructor, Thank you! Thank you!
Patient B," Well done, little girl!"
Instructor," First-year student from the Cecile Dorm, Anya Forger,"
Instructor, has earned a Stella for rescuing a boy.
Becky," You're amazing, Anya!"
Becky, You're the first of the first graders to get one!
Becky, I'm so proud of you for some reason.
Henry," Ultra-amazingly elegant, Miss Forger."
Becky," Well done, Anya!"
Damian, She b*at me.
Yor," You're amazing, Miss Anya! Truly amazing!"
Yor, I'm so happy for you!
Loid, She unexpectedly earned a Stella.
Loid," An excellent result,"
Loid, but how do I describe this?
Loid, It's similar to how I feel when I've thwarted a t*rror1st att*ck.
Loid, I'm so proud of her.
Loid, Well done.
Anya, Anya's powers actually helped someone?
Anya, Eheh!
Yor," All right, then. I'm going to make you a feast today."
Anya, Anya wants Papa to cook.
Stella needed to become an Imperial Scholar, Tonitrus Bolts until expulsion: Everyone's respect: +
Yor, Shock!
Handler," I heard that your daughter earned a Stella, Agent Twilight."
Loid," Yes, Handler. She somehow managed it."
Handler, Couldn't we set things up with other agents
Handler, to fake whatever you need to get the other Stella?
Loid, People would get suspicious.
Loid," More importantly, we can't take risks that could potentially"
Loid, expose the identities of other agents or get them arrested.
Handler," Yes, you've got a point."
Loid, Is HQ panicking a bit?
Handler, No.
Handler, But there are numerous businesses surrounding Desmond
Handler, that seem to be engaging in shady financial dealings lately.
Handler, We can't be too laid back in this situation.
Handler, Try to make contact with Desmond immediately.
Handler, Give your daughter some candy or something to get her motivated.
Girl student A, Morning!
Girl student B, Did you see that thing yesterday?
Boy student A, I forgot my homework!
Anya, Heh.
Boy student A," Hey, is that her? The girl from Class that suddenly got a Stella?"
Boy student B, Apparently it's a new record.
Girl student A, I heard she rescued someone.
Anya, This star is just so brilliant that I stand out now.
Boy student A, Really?
Anya, Heh.
Becky," Good morning, Anya!"
Anya," Tsk, tsk, tsk."
Anya," Call me ""Starlight Anya."""
Becky, Uh... Sure.
Becky, You're totally like a celebrity now.
Becky, Everyone looks up to you.
Becky, You might even make a hundred friends!
Anya as Damian, Bam!
Anya as Damian," I totally see you in a new light, Miss Anya! Be my friend!"
Anya as Damian, You should totally come over to my place with your dad!
Anya as Loid, Bam!
Anya as Loid," Well done, Anya! The mission is now a success!"
Narrator, And so the world was at peace.
Damian, Don't get a big head.
Becky, What's their problem? Ugh! They make me so mad!
Anya, That didn't go as planned. The world is in peril.
Becky," Let's go, Anya."
Becky," Let's go, Starlight Anya."
Anya, Yup.
Becky," Ugh, what a pain."
Boy student C, Ha. That's hilarious.
Boy student D, Who does she think she is?
Boy student D, She keeps showing off her stupid badge.
Boy student C, Who actually comes to school wearing it?
Girl student C, Who would believe such a violent girl actually rescued someone?
Girl student D," They say she saved a kid from drowning,"
Girl student D, but she probably kicked him in and let him sink herself.
Girl student C," Oh, I could totally see that!"
Girl student D, What if she actually paid the school a bunch of money for her Stella?
Girl student E, What? She doesn't look {/i}that{/i} rich to me.
Anya, Shock...
Becky, Don't even worry about it. They're all just jealous.
Girl student F," Hey, Damian. Wouldn't you agree?"
Girl student G," She totally cheated, didn't she?"
Damian, Do you really think we go to some third-rate school
Damian, that would hand out Stella by mistake?Or because someone was being underhanded?
Damian, Is that what you think?
Girl student F," Uh, no..."
Damian," If you've got a problem with our school,"
Damian, why don't you take the transfer exam for another one?
Ewen, He's so manly at times like this.
Emile," Gosh, he's cool."
Damian, The fact that she didn't cheat is why I'm so mad that this little shrimp got ahead of me.
Becky, Maybe he's more earnest than he looks.
Instructor, Let's begin class.
Becky," By the way,"
Becky," have you decided what your reward's going to be,"
Becky, An—Starlight Anya?
Anya, Reward?
Becky," Of course! Whenever you work really hard on tests or contests,"
Becky, you're supposed to get a reward.
Anya, You mean I can get peanuts?
Becky," Come on, you should ask for something way more expensive."
Becky," After the test we had the other day,"
Becky, I got them to buy me a cute little dress and a tiara!
Becky, But I mean...
Becky, I guess they haven't given me that much.
Anya, Is your family part of a secret organization that pulls the world's strings?
Becky, What are you talking about? They run a perfectly legitimate company.
Anya, Then Anya wants a castle.
Becky, That might be asking for too much.
Becky, Where would you even put it?
Anya, Then...
Anya, A year's worth of peanuts?
Becky," That shouldn't be a problem at all, but is that really what you want?"
Anya, Rewards are difficult.
Becky, Well... I think the reward that made me the happiest is my little Wiesel.
Becky," Oh, that's my puppy! It's the cutest!"
Becky," Come here, Weezy!"
Anya, Mister Dog?
Anya," Do you have a dog, too, Second Son?"
Damian, Huh? A dog?
Becky, What are you asking that jerk for?
Damian, Max!
Damian, Who cares?
Damian, Don't talk to me!
Anya," Anya has a doggy now, too."
Anya as Damian," All right! Let's see who's cuter, yours or my Max!"
Anya as Damian," Bring it over to my place! And your dad, too!"
Anya as Donovan," Well, hello, Mr. Forger."
Anya as Loid," Let's stop this w*r, Mr. Desmond."
Narrator, And so the world was at peace.
Anya, Heh.
Loid, You want a dog... as a reward?
Anya, Mm-hm.
Anya, Having a dog will bring peace.
Loid, Peace? Like peace of mind?
Loid," Hmm... Well, I was thinking of buying you something."
Yor, Miss Anya...
Yor, Taking care of a living creature requires a lot of work.
Yor, It is a very big responsibility!
Anya, Responsibility...
Loid," A dog, huh? Yeah..."
Loid, Let's discuss this a bit further.
Yor, Loid...
Anya, Papa!
Loid, A properly trained dog may prove useful in securing this house.
Yor," Dogs are so violent, though."
Yor, I'm so terribly worried that one might rip Miss Anya to shreds.
Anya," Anya would like a cute puppy, please, Papa."
Anya, A tiny one.
Loid," Huh? Sure, all right."
Loid," Ah, well. I'm sure we can find a small dog that's still capable."
Loid, I'll see if HQ can get us one later.
Loid, All right. Why don't we go to a pet shop this weekend?
Smuggler A, We get a buyer yet?
Smuggler B, Things are pretty tough right now.
Smuggler B, We got some punks who think they're revolutionaries.
Smuggler A," What, they gonna use 'em as b*mb dogs?"
Smuggler A," These little guys sure have it rough,"
Smuggler A, getting tinkered with just so they can end up as toys for some humans.
Smuggler B," Shut up! If you want food, quit yer yappin'!"
Smuggler A, They sure don't look that smart.
Smuggler A, Do Numbers Three and Five look weaker to you?
Smuggler B, Hell if I know. Who cares?
Smuggler A," God, it always reeks in here."
Smuggler B," Yeah, let's get the hell outta here."
Anya, Anya wants this one...
Anya, Or this one!
Yor," Oh, thank goodness. They look very weak."
Narrator," The capitol of Ostania, Berlint."
Narrator," This old woman is a contact for Westalis's intelligence agency, WISE."
Narrator," This man's name is Loid Forger,"
Narrator," otherwise known by his code name, Twilight."
Narrator, His occupation: spy.
Narrator," It appears as though, on top of the current important mission he is conducting,"
Narrator, he's been given another.
Old woman, This has been my life for decades now.
Old woman," Every day remains the same, and peace is fleeting."
Old woman, Will we ever see a day
Old woman, when we're not needed anymore?
Loid, Mission complete.
Contact," Good day, or perhaps, good evening, Twilight."
Contact, We thank you for completing that mission so quickly.
Contact, How goes Operation Strix?
Narrator, That is his top-priority mission to maintain peace between the East and the West.
Narrator, That mission...
Loid, It's going smoothly.
Loid, I have secured both a wife and child.
Narrator," ...is meant to bring the enemy country's plans for w*r to light,"
Narrator," establish a family in said country, and infiltrate a certain academy."
Contact, Very good. Not standing out is an iron-clad rule for a spy.
Contact, Continue acting as a completely mundane family.
Loid, I know.
Contact, Did you quit smoking?
Loid," Well, I have a child now."
Narrator," And thus, the Forgers came to be without issue, but..."
Yor," Loid did mention that he was going to be late,"
Yor, so why don't we eat out tonight?
Anya, Yep.
Yor, Doctors sure are busy. It must be difficult.
Anya, Papa is not actually a doctor.
Narrator," His daughter, Anya, whom he just happened to adopt from an orphanage..."
Anya, Papa's real job is a spy.
Anya," Today, he went to take down an arms dealer."
Narrator, ...is an Esper who can read minds.
Anya, I bring you my dish!
Yor," Thank you very much, Miss Anya."
Yor, Hmm... It's just not washing off...
Narrator," His wife, Yor, who agreed to this arrangement because of a common interest..."
Yor, I can still smell the blood from yesterday's k*ll.
Narrator, ...is a hardcore assassin.
Narrator," A spy, a telepath, and an assassin."
Narrator, The three decided to live under one roof
Narrator," for their own reasons while concealing their true identities,"
Narrator, and so their less-than-mundanefamily life continues on.
STRIX," ,PENGUIN PARK"
Loid," I keep getting all these extra missions every day, on top of Operation Strix."
Loid, HQ must be in dire straits over the personnel shortage.
Loid," When I get home, I have my pretend family to deal with."
Loid," I am an agent. Therefore, my soul has no time to rest."
Wife A," Hey, don't you think the husband across the hall must be in trouble?"
Wife A," It's supposed to be a day off, but he's working late into the night again."
Loid, They're our neighbors...
Wife B," And they have a little child. That poor, neglected thing."
Wife C, I rarely see the three of them together.
Wife B, He's probably off cheating somewhere!
Wife B, How awful!
Wife A," Maybe he actually got fired, and he can't bring himself to go home."
Loid, I was careless.
Loid, I was so consumed by my other missions
Loid, that I neglected playing the role of the father well.
Loid, Even the slightest suspicion or mistrust from those around us in a deception operation
Loid, can be detrimental.
Loid, I must do everything I can to remedy this situation.
Loid, A thr*at to our family is a thr*at to the world!
Loid, We're going out next weekend!
Loid, The three of us will have a good time. Where do we want to go?
Loid," Oh? Is that a penguin, Anya?"
Loid, I know. Let's go to the aquarium.
Yor, Um... You seem exhausted. Why not get some rest?
Loid," Yor, in order for our pretend marriage to continue,"
Loid," we must do everything we can to seem like a normal, happy family."
Loid, So look forward to the weekend!
Anya, So exciting!
Loid, I need to take care of all of my other missions before then.
Loid, Well... let's go.
Yor," Loid, perhaps you really should get some rest."
Loid, I'm perfectly fine.
Wife C," Oh, if it isn't the Forgers."
Wife C, It's so rare to see all of you together.
Loid, We're about to go enjoy some time together at the aquarium.
Loid," Isn't that exciting, Anya?"
Wife D, I see...
Loid, We need to show our neighbors what a happy family we are
Loid, so they don't ever suspect that we're a pretend family.
Anya," My papa, who is taking us on an ooting,"
Anya," and my mama, who is very kind to my papa, are both very good people."
Anya, I think our family is completely normal.
Loid," That sounded more like an explanation than anything else, but good enough."
Loid," Now, then..."
Loid, If you'll excuse us.
Anya," Please wait, Papa, who is a very good and normal person!"
Anya, Ba-donk ka-chonk!
Loid, Another summons? I have a bad feeling about this.
Loid, I'm going to go buy us some drinks.
Yor, All right.
Old woman," Agent Twilight, we've got another additional mission for you tod—"
Loid, I cannot.
Old Woman, This is straight from WISE HQ—
Loid, I cannot. Today is a very important day for Operation Strix.
Anya, Papa!
Anya," We need to hurry, or the aquarium will go out of business!"
Loid," Don't worry, they just remodeled the place."
Loid, Just wait patiently.
Loid, There you have it.
Loid," Anyway, I'll take one coffee, one juice—"
Old woman," Hang on! Did you say ""aquarium""?"
Old woman," Splendid, Agent Twilight."
Old woman, The location of this mission just happens to be Berlint Aquarium!
Old woman, I am blown away at how prepared you are!
Loid," No, really. This was a coincidence."
Loid, Could I get that coffee and juice now?
Old woman, There will be some intel traded at the aquarium—
Loid," My coffee and juice, please."
Old woman," Listen to me carefully, Twilight."
Old woman, This intel contains instructions from another country for making a new chemical w*apon.
Old woman," If t*rrorists get their hands on this information,"
Old woman, many will perish in our country!
Anya, So many... fishies!
Anya, An octopus!
Anya, Starfish.
Anya, A tiny shark!
Yor, She looks like she's having fun.
Yor, Loid...
Yor, You look so pale. Are you all right?
Loid, I ended up taking the mission.
Loid, But we did successfully show the neighbors how well we get along.
Loid, As long as I can get through this separate mission...
Wife A," Oh, if it isn't the Forgers from across the hall."
Wife A, What a coincidence.
Yor," Oh, hello."
Loid, You can't... be serious!
Wife A," We just got here, too."
Loid, Now I definitely can't relax.
Loid," Actually, we just need to shoo them off, and—"
Yor, Would you like to join us?
Loid, Yor!
Wife A, What a great idea.
Anya, Papa is funny.
Yor," If we want to appear normal,"
Yor, we need to keep up a good relationship with our neighbors.
Loid," Very well, then."
Loid," I'll take care of this mission immediately, and then return to weekend mode."
flashback Old woman," According to our intel,"
Old woman, they smuggled in a capsule containing film by making a penguin swallow it.
Loid, Why a penguin?
Old woman, It was brought in sometime yesterday at an unknown time.
Old woman, The recipient has not appeared yet.
Old woman," You must retrieve the goods before the enemy organization does, no matter what!"
Loid, Why don't we check out the penguin exhibit?It seems to be the main attraction.
Wife A and B, Okay.
Anya, I like penguins! I wanna see!
Announcer, Welcome to the world's biggest penguin park!
Anya, P-P-P-Penguins!
Announcer, Our most recommended attraction at this aquarium
Announcer, is our adorable underwater show that stars penguins!
Loid, Exactly which penguin is my target?
Loid, There's no time to check each and every penguin.
Loid, I'd have a better chance of stopping the t*rror1st from obtaining the film...
Loid," No... Since I don't know when the recipient is going to show up,"
Loid," that'll be difficult, as well."
Loid, I won't be able to keep an eye on all of these penguins alone.
Loid, What am I going to do?
Loid, There has to be something...
Loid, They must've marked the penguin somehow to tell it apart from the others.
Anya, Papa is troubled.
Yor," Loid is so enthusiastic. I guess he lets his inner child out sometimes, too."
s voice A," Hey, that fish looks tasty."
s voice," Wait, where did my kid go?!"
s voice B, I hope my girlfriend stops being so angry.
s voice A, Fish...
Anya, It's hard to read the minds of penguins.
s voice B, Let's play.
s voice C, I'mma eat some fish.
s voice D, I'm hungry.
s voice E, Come over here.
Anya," Papa, that penguin looks like it can't breathe."
Loid, It's drinking a lot of water only to spit it all back out.
Loid, It's possible there's something stuck in its throat.
Loid, This is definitely worth investigating.
Loid, Sorry. I'm going to go buy some drinks real quick.
Yor, Loid... His exhaustion must be making him so thirsty.
Chief, Hey! Where's the new guy we're supposed to get today?
Chief, He's this late on his first day?
Loid, Sorry I'm late!
Chief, What's wrong with you young'uns today?
Chief, I'll show you how to feed the penguins. Follow me.
Loid," Yes, sir!"
Loid, The fastest way to get closer to the target penguin without causing a commotion
Loid, is to disguise myself as one of the aquarists.
Sign, Agent Twilight's Specialty: Disguises
Chief, The first thing a newbie has to learn is all of the penguins' faces and names.
Chief, Did you memorize the roster?
Loid, Yes. I glanced through it quickly in the staff room.
Chief, You glanced through? You moron!
Chief," Even with me, it took two years to learn all ..."
Loid," Oh, Chief. You're about to step on poor Petilda behind you."
Chief, This is indeed Petilda.
Loid," This one is Pemas, and this is Pescar."
Chief," How can you tell, newbie?"
Loid," Huh? Well, all of their patterns are completely different."
Loid," Their faces and heights, too."
Chief, Even I still mistake them every once in a while.
Chief, I can't believe this guy's observation skills and memory.
Chief," All right, then. Let's get to feeding them."
Chief, This way.
Loid, The penguin I spotted earlier is...
Loid," Right there. Parles, the emperor penguin."
Loid, I need to get to him immediately and...
Loid, Wh-Wha?!
Loid, I-I can't go any further.
Chief, We've got big eaters and fussy eaters.
Chief," Each penguin has unique eating habits, so pay attention."
Loid, I don't have time for this.
Loid," I need to hurry back, or the neighbors will be suspicious."
Loid, Chief!
Loid, Allow me to do the honors!
Chief and Aquarist, What?
Loid, I figured this out watching veteran aquarists...
Loid, The most important thing is how each penguin eats.
Loid," How much they eat, what kind of food it is,"
Loid, and where each group is located.
Loid, As long as I can figure these things out...
Loid, Controlling the masses is mere child's play.
Chief, That's no ordinary newbie!
Loid, Uh-oh. Apparently Parles isn't very hungry.
Loid," He might be sick, so I'll take him to the treatment room."
Loid, If you'll excuse me for a bit.
Chief, S-Sure...
Loid," Sorry, little guy."
Loid, Bingo! There's something stuck in his throat.
Loid," Upon closer observation, it seems there's a mark on the bottom of his foot, too."
Loid," Just a second, little guy. I'll get it out for you."
Man from Org, You there.
Man from Org, What are you planning to do with that penguin?
Loid," He's not feeling well, so I'm taking him to the treatment room."
Man from Org, I see. Allow me to do that for you.
Loid, I'm terribly sorry. Only staff are allowed to handle them.
Man from Org, My apologies.
Man from Org, I'm a professor from Berlint University's marine biology research lab.
Man from Org, I'm in charge of the marine animals here.
Loid, This ID is fake.
Loid, It's not even well-made.
Man from Org," Who do you work for, you—"
Loid, You're not getting away!
Loid," Hey, be still!"
Chief," Hey, newbie!"
Chief, Where are you taking that penguin?
Chief, The treatment room is that way!
Loid, I can't carelessly let him go without knowing how many enemies are here.
Loid, My top priority is retrieving this film.
Loid, I'll have to give up on chasing after him.
Yor," Oh, no... Now where did Miss Anya run off to?"
Man from Org," I need to let my comrades outside know to k*ll that man,"
Man from Org, and retrieve the film—
Man from Org, Who the hell are you?!
Anya, Mama! I'm being kidnapped!
Yor, Miss Anya?!
Man from Org, Let go of me!
Man from Org, What are you talking ab—
Yor, What do you think...
Yor, you're doing to my daughter?!
Anya, Wow.
Yor, Are you all right?
Yor," Oh, no. I definitely overdid it."
Yor, I hope he's not dead...
Loid, Wow.
Narrator," And so, Twilight was able to retrieve the film"
Narrator, and get information about the enemy organization from the man they captured.
Wife A," You know, your husband hasn't come back at all."
Wife A," I'm telling you, he's cheating!"
Wife, How awful!
Yor, Huh? That's not...
Loid, I'm sorry I took so long!
Yor, Loid!
Loid, Ta-da!
Anya, A penguin!
Yor," Oh, what a big stuffed penguin! Where did you get it?"
Loid, It was a prize from the penguin name-guessing challenge they were doing over there.
Loid," I just had to get it for Anya, so I kept trying over and over."
Loid," Boy, it sure was difficult."
Anya, Papa is a liar. He actually got it in one try.
Yor, He got so worked up. How adorable.
Wife A, You're a better father than I thought.
Wife A, I'm impressed.
Loid, You flatter me.
Loid, I'm just a simple father trying not to stumble around too much
Yor," It's bigger than you, Miss Anya."
Loid, as I protect my happy little family.
Wife A," Now that I've gotten a closer look at you, you're quite handsome."
Loid," Looks like things are going to work out here, too."
Loid, But I'm absolutely done with all this excessive overwork.
Loid, I'm going to file a complaint to HQ and request a long vaca—
Loid, No...
Loid, Maintaining a world where children don't cry...
Loid, A world with no w*r...
Loid, That is my duty.
Loid, I have no time to stand by idly.
Anya, Papa! The dolphin show is gonna start!
Loid," Sorry, could you walk a little slower?"
Newbie aquarist, What?! You want me to be the chief?!
Newbie aquarist, But why?!
Chief, I have nothing more to teach you.
Chimera," So you're the new recruit, eh?"
Penguin, It is a pweasure to meet your acquaintenance.
Chimera, Indeed.
Chimera," Agent Anya, you know what to do."
Anya, Yep!
Chimera, We have a ritual in which we both eat the halves of a split peanut.
Chimera," Once you have completed this task,"
Chimera, you will be officially recognized as a member of this organization.
Anya, Om...
Chimera," Starting today, you will be known as Agent Penguinman."
Chimera, Do your best for peace.
Penguin, Yep.
Chimera," Agent Anya, show our new agent around our hideout."
Anya, Okey-dokey!
Anya, This is our hideout's command room.
Anya, We gather intel from this machine every day.

Anya, This is Agent Papa. He is a super-elite that can do anything.
Loid, Um... what? Is she pretending to be a spy?
Anya, This is Agent Mama.
Anya," She's strong, but fails at everything else."
Yor, Am I that much of a failure?!
Anya, They are Anya's trusted lackeys.
Anya," Okay, onward to the next spot."
Yor, It looks like Miss Anya has taken quite a liking to that plushie.
Loid, Mm...
Anya, This is the bathroom!
Anya, You can heal your wounds from battle here.
Anya, This is Anya's room. I train in here every day.
Anya, And...
Anya, The most top-secret spots in our hideout.
Anya, Papa's room and Mama's room!
Anya, Be on your guard.
Anya," If you discover the secret of these rooms, you won't leave alive."
Anya," We might find the ultimate Kn*fe, or the ultimate b*mb!"
Anya," Now, then..."
Loid, Hey! What do you think you're doing?!
Loid, How many times have I told you not to go in there without permission?!
Loid," Er, it's just, there's a lot of dangerous things in there, like scissors and heaters."
Loid," Honestly, there are far more dangerous things in there."
Yor," Yes, you shouldn't go in mine, either."
Yor, My room has poisoned needles and such.
Anya," Papa and Mama, I hate you both!"
Anya, Anya's gonna run away from home!
Loid," Not good. At this rate, Operation Strix is going to collapse!"
Loid, What should I do?
Loid, A-Agent Anya!
Loid, There's no time for crying! World peace is on the line!
Loid, L-Let's wrap up the tour of the hideout and head out for our next mission!
Yor, Y-Yes! Let's go b*at the bad guys!
Anya," Okay! Follow me, you two!"
Anya, The bad guys have taken over the candy store on nd Street.
Anya, Let's go save them!
Loid and Yor, Huh?
Anya, Be careful.
Anya, The enemy might have set traps.
Loid," W-Well done, Agent Anya."
Townsperson , What is that?
Townsperson ," Aw, what a sweet family."
Loid, A spy must not stand out...
Narrator," Later on, Anya's mood improved after they bought her a snack,"
Narrator, and peace was restored to the Forger household.
Yor, Are you all right?!
Yor, Hey.
Yor, Slow down and eat.
Anya, Fanks for the food!
Anya," Papa, Mama, hurry it up already!"
Loid, What are we going to do with her?
Yor," Well, it's no surprise she's excited."
Sign, PROJECT APPLE
Narrator, Since today's the day...
Dogs," Woof, woof, woof-woof..."
Anya," Woof, woof, woof-woof..."
Handler," You're so excited, Miss Anya."
Anya, Does Mister Dog eat peanuts?
Loid, You probably shouldn't give one too many.
Anya, Boo...
Loid, Let's make sure to give the doggies what they like.
Loid, Our outing today is actually for Operation Strix. Our destination: a pet shop.
Narrator," We're here. This is because Anya said she wanted a dog as her reward for earning a Stella. Until she gets eight Stella and I get into that social gathering, I need to keep her motivation high, no matter what."
Anya," Reward, reward! Woof, woof, woof-woof!"
Pet Shop Owner, Welcome.
Loid," Well, what do you think, sir? We've made sure to properly train all of our dogs. This is a pet shop that works with our agency, and sells war dogs. I figured if we're going to get a dog, we'd be best off with a guard dog for safety reasons, but..."
Loid," Don't they look very smart and cute, Anya?"
Anya, That's a no!
Yor, She clearly doesn't want any of them!
Anya, Me strong.
Yor, Don't you have any that are a bit smaller and at least a little cute?
Anya, Gots big muscles.
Pet Shop Owner, Hmm... I guess I could ask a breeder I know.
Narrator, Anya doesn't like any of them.
Yor," Oh, yes, they do look a bit mean."
Loid," Apparently, a shelter is having an adoption event right now. Then we'll just head over there."
Loid, A new order?
Loid," Sorry, I suddenly have a stomachache. You two go ahead to the shelter by the station. I'm going to find a bathroom."
Yor, Huh? Are you all right? We can wait right here.
Anya," Papa takes a really long time when he goes to the shitter to shit, so we should probably go."
Yor, I-Is that so?
Yor, All right...
Yor," You need to watch your mouth, young lady."
Loid," An excellent assist, but at the same time... yeah."
Loid," Wait... You didn't say anything about taking me all the way to headquarters. If I take too long, my family will get suspicious."
Handler," If you've got a problem, take it up with Handler. This is an emergency summons."
Handler, A plot to assassinate Foreign Minister Brantz?
Loid, They're probably targeting tonight's summit.
Handler," The ones believed to be behind this are a group of isolationists who attend Berlint University. Apparently, the Secret Police also had their eyes on them. We just happened to apprehend one of them who was hanging around the embassy. We're currently interrogating him. But he won't tell us where his friends are or anything else."
Loid, And that's why I was called in?
Handler, Being both a papa and an agent... Must be tough balancing the two.
Loid, Being a father is part of the mission. But I guess the times are changing... To think that a child like him could be a terrorist.
Terrorist, Keep coming back all you want. I'm never gonna talk. I won't sell out my comrades.
Handler," That's quite all right. You're no longer necessary. We've captured your leader, after all."
Terrorist," Keith?! I-It was him! He planned all this! We were tricked into helping him! You gotta believe me! I didn't do anything wrong! Uh, Keith? What are you... I'll tell you anything you want! Just let me go!"
Handler, Shut up and keep walking.
Loid, He just...
Handler, Is he really gonna put this all on me?
Handler, Some comrade.
Handler," Well, it doesn't really matter to us which one of you is the leader. We only care about which one gives us the intel we need. Now, what do we do with you?"
Terrorist," Wait, it's not me! He's the leader! I'm not lying! He's the one... who proposed the plan..."
Handler, I'd love to hear more.
Terrorist," Keith planned out all of it. Thank goodness we had some footage of Keith's past activities. I just went along with it. I'll tell you what I know about the other members, too. First, there's Kurt, who's in the same program as Keith. It's impossible for me to perfectly play the role based on such a short video. There's also a handful of guys from the psych program. If we were dealing with a pro, he would've been on to us. I don't usually talk to them, so I don't know their names. There's also Kevin and Kim from the engineering program. Those are all the guys I know. Our hideouts are a warehouse near the university and the second floor of a bar on th Street."
Handler, Exactly how were you going to carry out the assassination?
Terrorist, Dogs. I don't know exactly how many... But the plan was to strap bombs onto a dozen or so dogs and have them ambush him while he was on the move.
Handler, Bomb dogs?
Loid, Not good. It's not gonna be easy stopping trained dogs.
Handler," But that's impossible. Giving a war dog proper special training costs just about as much as a small missile per dog. I can't imagine ordinary students being able to afford that. Either they have someone from the far right backing them, or there's a sympathizer from a third power."
Handler," As you heard, we've got quite the problem on our hands. In order to stop this terrorist attack, we'll have to make the first move."
Loid, Could we not have the summit canceled?
Handler, Doubtful. The Eastern government has a reputation to uphold. Though I'm sure the opposition would be thrilled. Casually leak this information to the ruling party. I'm sure they'll also want to avoid any pointless trouble.
Handler," Yes, ma'am."
Loid," Sorry, but we'll need your help for a bit longer."
Loid, Understood.
Handler," Relations between the East and West are on thin ice. Regardless of whether the assassination is a success or not, if this becomes public, the ice may finally break. We're going to stop them, whatever it takes."
Guard, I'm gonna go buy some coffee. Wait here.
Guard," You better behave, pups."
Loid," Well, these dogs are definitely smart, even if they're up there in years already."
Anya, Hey!
Yor, You'll trip if you run like that!
Terrorist," Hey, damn it!"
Loid," Hey, where'd this dog come from?!"
Anya, No! He's gonna eat me!
Stranger," Whoa, that sign fell. That startled me. That sure was a close one, kid. Did you just save me?"
Dog, Borf.
Terrorist," Er, sorry about my dog, ma'am. Don't go running off like that, you dumb mutt!"
Terrorist, What's wrong?
Terrorist, This stupid dog just bolted on me.
Terrorist, Are these dogs really gonna work?
Terrorist," Not like we can change our plan now. We got the area all checked out and ready, so let's head back. We'll be in a world of hurt if we piss off Keith."
Yor, So this is an adoption event. It's bigger than I had imagined. I wonder why Loid didn't bring us here first.
Anya, Tiny doggies!
Yor, Kitties!
Anya, Bunnies!
Yor," Oh! You mustn't, Miss Anya! You'll get lost! Listen carefully. Promise me you won't leave this area with the doggies."
Anya, Okay.
Yor, Oh... That dachshund is adorable! Its legs are so short!
Anya," It's cute even with stubby legs? Does that mean Anya's cute, too?"
Anya, A Chihuahua!
Anya, A Pomeranyan!
Shelter Worker," Huff, huff, huff... Are you looking for a dog to adopt? Is there a breed that's easy to keep?"
Anya," Huff, huff, huff..."
Anya, What a big Mister Dog. Anya's family?
Terrorist," What's wrong now? Come on, start walking!"
Anya, Was that... Mister Dog's thoughts?
Shelter Worker," Toy poodles rarely shed, so cleaning up after them is a breeze."
Anya, Mama! There is a doggy that knows about our family!
Yor," What are you talking about, dear?"
Shelter Worker," If you're looking for smaller breeds, Shih Tzus are very friendly."
Anya, Just for a little bit...
Anya, A shop? Where did Mister Dog go?
Anya, Mister Dog...
Anya, Who are you?
Terrorist, You better not have done anything to draw attention.
Terrorist, D-Don't worry. There were people with dogs everywhere because of the adoption event.
Keith," It's finally time. If this plan with the bomb dogs is a success, the façade between the East and the West will finally come down. In order to restore Ostania to its former glory... We'll just have Foreign Minister Brantz become the catalyst for war. We're going to bring down those arrogant pigs of the West."
Terrorist, Bring them down!
Anya, B-Bad guys?! This is the bad guys' house!
Keith," Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?"
Terrorist, This little brat heard everything!
Keith," Wait, are you serious? Who is that?"
Terrorist, Uh... Wh-What do we do?
Keith," Whoa, there!"
Terrorist, What are we gonna do? Well... We'll just have to take care of her.
Terrorist," Yo, Keith, come on. She's just a little kid."
Keith," If she tattles to her parents, our plan will be ruined. Kurt, keep her mouth shut."
Anya, Mister Dog!
Keith, Damn it... He's not listening again! Maybe this one was a dud.
Keith, You picked the wrong guy to borf at. I'll shut you up for good.
Anya, Shock!
Terrorist, This little...
Keith, Don't. Don't damage the goods. But we need to shut him up.
Keith, That's no problem. No one's gonna pay it any mind if they hear a dog barking today.
Yor, Miss Anya? Where did you go?!
Yor," Um, pardon me. Did you happen to see a little girl who looks like this?"
Stranger, Dunno... I can't say I have.
Yor, She's not here. She's nowhere in the venue... Could it be... that she was eaten by a dog?!
Yor, Aaaaaa...
Yor," No, no, calm down, Yor. That is probably unlikely. But then, could she have been... kidnapped?! There have been a string of kidnappings in Central Ariane involving young women who were abducted and forced into marriage."
Stranger," Oh, how frightening."
Stranger, I'll make you my bride.
Yor, Mrrrgh...
Yor," Wh-Wh-Wh-What should I do?! Miss Anya will be forced to marry someone! Of course this had to happen when Loid isn't here. Oh, what do I do? Whatever shall I do? Please hurry back from the bathroom, Loid!"
Loid, All of the locations he offered up turned out to be duds. How is it on your end?
Handler," Bingo. There were two white vans rented here under the name of one of the terrorists, Kevin Knowles. The plate numbers are..."
Handler," Excellent work. I'll have someone look into this immediately. Oh, as for where they were getting the dogs, one lead was particularly suspicious. I'm sure even you've heard of it before... Project Apple. It was research done under the former government of Ostania, to try to create animals with terrifyingly high IQ for military purposes."
Loid," I'm aware of it. I heard they repeated some pretty reckless experiments, but the government fell apart during their research, and the project came to a standstill. They say it ended with mediocre results that were far from their intended goal."
Handler, Correct. And then came rumors that the dogs and other animals that were no longer needed ended up on the black market instead of being put down.
Loid, And you think the terrorists got a hold of them?
Handler," It's possible. They may be the survivors of a failed experiment, but they are probably still highly intelligent pigs of the West. Be on your guard. The unexpected may very likely happen."
Keith," Get away from the dog, you stupid brat. Then I promise you'll at least die painlessly."
Terrorist, Phone?
Keith, Hey. If you don't hurry up...
Keith," Man, that scared me."
Keith, Who the hell's calling us right now?
Keith, Hello?
Keith, What? Seriously?
Keith," Hey, Keith, we've got trouble! Apparently some suspicious guys showed up at two of our hideouts!"
Keith, D-Don't tell me it's the Secret Police...
Terrorist, How?! Did someone leak info?
Keith," Tch. I haven't seen Chris all morning, so I kind of suspected, but... It was a good idea to move locations. Nobody panic! We're switching over to Plan B and..."
Terrorist, Hey! Where'd the brat go?
Terrorist, Huh? Wh-What the?!
Anya," Mister Dog is Anya's friend? Wait, did you know the phone was going to ring before it did? You... can see the future? Is it a telepath like me?"
Anya, Mister Dog! Go into that building! Mama will save us!
Anya, No! Not that way! Go back!
Yor, Miss Anya?!
Keith, What are you dumbasses doing?!
Terrorist, We were distracted by the phone...
Keith, Whatever. Who cares about her? We need to get the plan rolling.
Keith, You idiots! She's seen our faces!
Keith," Hey, Kurt, come with me! We're taking one of the dogs, too."
Terrorist, You're gonna go after her?
Keith," Tear that map off the wall. We're abandoning this hideout, too. You guys get to the designated location and spread out."
Terrorist, Got it.
Anya, Dog! Stop! Let me down! Someone save me! I'm being chased by bad guys!
Stranger, What is that? How cute. I wonder if she's playing tag.
Anya," Mister Dog runs so fast! He's so fast, and... So exciting! Okay, Mister Dog! Let's make a break for it and go right to the police ociffers! Anya and Mister Dog... are gonna solve this on our own and save the day! And then... I'll be Starlight Anya again!"
Keith, Thanks for saving us the trouble. We're right back where we started!
Keith, Right face! You're not getting away.
Keith, Do it. Make it quick.
Terrorist, R-Right...
Terrorist," No hard feelings, kid."
Yor," You won't get away with this, Mr. Perverted Kidnapper! It is far too early for Miss Anya to get married!"
Yor, I wish I could
Yor, Even I just got married this year!
Yor," Well, apparently I've discovered that"
Yor, I can take these yawn-filled days
Yor, And turn them into movies
Yor, I've found the secret and trick to it
Yor, Under this sky where we don't get along
Yor, I closed my heart and locked it
Yor, That's how I've managed to live my life
Yor, And the melodies now overlap
Yor," I wanted a sign, no matter how small"
Yor, That I could actually find better than any streetlight
Yor, I put a ribbon on each of the sights that my eyes pick out
Yor, And I collect them like souvenirs as I continue down this path home
Yor," The seasons each say hello, and I shed a few tears as I go"
Yor, Where should I begin to talk about this way home that you've given me?
Yor, I walk and walk and sometimes rush on my way to see you
Yor," I run and run, wait, no, I should still walk on my way to see you"
Anya, Mama!
Anya, I was so scared!
Yor," There, there. You're all right now."
Onlooker, That's her mother?
Anya," Hey, come back here!"
Anya, Mama! I'm scared!
Yor, What? But you're safe now.
Yor," Oh, damn it!"
Yor, Fine!
Yor, Hey! Wait!
Yor," No... You mustn't leave Miss Anya alone again, Yor."
Yor, That should teach Mr. Kidnapper a lesson.
Yor," First, I should hand this man over to the police."
Yor," Are you okay, Mister Dog?"
Anya, Who is that puppy?
Anya, Um...
Yor, What?! Terrorists and bomb puppies?!
Anya, Bombs?
Yor, He doesn't... seem to have a bomb.
Anya, Mister Dog here saved me.
Yor," Th-The most important thing is that you're safe, Miss Anya."
Yor, I was so worried.
Anya, Anya is sorry... that she ran off without permission.
Yor, Honestly...
Yor, I'll have to give you a stern talking-to when we get home.
Yor," A-Anyway, we need to report this to the police."
Yor," Miss Anya, do you happen to remember what the bad guys looked like,"
Yor, or perhaps parts of their conversation?
Anya, Um... I'll try real hard to remember!
Yor, And that's what happened.
Yor, Yes.
Yor," One is here next to me, unconscious."
Yor," Oh, no! I'm just a housewife that happened to pass by."
Anya, Mister Dog?
Anya, Are you... looking into the future again?
Anya, Papa's gone?
Anya, Where is this?
Anya, Papa!
Reporter, Westalis condemns in the strongest terms the Ostanian government regarding the incident with the minister and the extremists.
Reporter, It is believed that a conflict between the East and West is now unavoidable.
Anya, That was from the future!
Anya, The future is in trouble! Papa is gonna die and peace will be over!
Yor," Now, now, Miss Anya! You mustn't be mean to the poor puppy."
Anya," Oh, nothing... Anyway..."
Anya, Papa is going to die in an explosion.
Anya, I'll tell Mama and have her save him.
Anya, But I can't tell her about my powers.
Anya, Mister Dog... Can we change the future if we try real hard?
Dog, Borf!
Anya," Mama, I'm sorry. I just remembered something."
Anya, Papa forgot to take toilet paper to the potty with him!
Yor, Huh?
Anya," He might be in big trouble now, so I'm gonna go take him some toilet paper!"
Yor, Miss Anya... Wait!
Yor, She ran off again...
Yor," Oh, I'm sorry. But that's the story."
Yor, Please make sure you arrest this man.
Yor, Wai—
Yor, Miss Anya!
Yor, Miss Anya! Where did you go?
Handler, We've intercepted a report of a terrorist sighted in an alley near Central Station.
Handler, The physical description matches one of the students.
Handler, So they're on the move.
Handler, Have a team stand by on the suspected route they may take from the reported area.
Handler, We'll commandeer the white van that comes through.
Handler, It might be carrying explosives. Proceed with caution.
Agent Alpha, How...
Agent Alpha, Alpha Team here. We've secured the targets.
Agent Alpha, Four members and three dogs.
Agent Alpha, We also found a case possibly containing explosives.
Agent Bravo, Bravo here.
Agent Bravo, We've also captured three members.
Agent Bravo," Our main target, Keith Kepler, is nowhere to be found."
Agent Bravo, We will continue our search of the area.
Keith, They're onto us! Is that the Secret Police?
Keith," No, are they from the West?"
Keith, What should I do?
Keith, I've only got two hours before the summit starts.
Keith," There's one more place where we have bombs hidden, but..."
Keith, There's no other way! Even if I have to do this on my own!
Agent, Spit it out!
Agent," Where's the explosion site, and where's Keith?!"
Terrorist," My only answer to that is, ""Eat shit."""
Terrorist," Go stick your head in a shitter, you putrid swine!"
Terrorist, Strike down the pigs from the West!
Terrorist, Strike them down!
Terrorist, Strike them down!
Agent, You little punk...
Agent, Leave the howling to the dogs. You're making my ears hurt.
Sylvia," Hello there, students."
Sylvia, What exactly do you want?
Sylvia, Have any of you actually killed a person before?
Sylvia, Have you ever been killed by anyone?
Sylvia, Have you ever lost a limb in an attack?
Sylvia, Have you ever heard bones being smashed?
Sylvia, Have you ever smelled festering flesh?
Sylvia," Have you ever seen your parents or siblings crushed in a crumbling building, right before your eyes?"
Sylvia, Have you ever seen a piece of your lover's flesh stuck to a wall?
Sylvia," Have you ever been so hungry, you tried to bite into a tree?"
Sylvia, Have you ever stewed human flesh in a pot?
Sylvia," Have you ever had someone close to you deny your enemy's humanity so they could continue the killing,"
Sylvia, only to become so mentally broken after the conflict is over
Sylvia," that they weep with regret and shame,"
Sylvia," vomit, and then eventually... take their own life?"
Sylvia," Apparently, you've learned nothing of war at your university, you utter children."
Sylvia, Listen up...
Sylvia," Once you catch the minister's scent, don't you dare lose sight of him."
Sylvia," I'm counting on you, pup."
Keith, But... the point where we were supposed to ambush him in Plan B
Keith," might've also been discovered, since those guys got caught."
Keith," Which would mean more guards in the area around the clock tower plaza, making it useless."
Keith," Actually, in that case,"
Keith, I'll just lure any bastards who try to get in my way into a trap and eliminate them!
Keith," Just you wait, you pigs!"
Keith, I'll blow you all to smithereens!
Handler, All teams: investigate points B through B .
Handler," Twilight, I'd like you to investigate the area around B ,"
Handler, which will be the most probable target.
Twilight," Stop them, no matter what."
Twilight," I know, Handler."
Twilight, I agree with you.
Twilight, I am absolutely done... with war.
Anya, Found it! It's where the pointy clock is!
Anya," That way, Mister Dog!"
Anya, That's where Papa's gonna die!
Reporter," Here in Central Berlint,"
Yor," Well, apparently I've discovered that I can take these yawn-filled days and turn them into movies. I've found the secret and trick to it.

Loid," I walk and walk and sometimes rush on my way to see you. I run and run, wait, no, I should still walk on my way to see you."
Anya, Its teeth are in him?! This is it!
Anya," Explode, you pig!"
Loid, What?
Loid, The bomb ended up in the river? The minister threw it?!
Loid, Sorry about this!
Loid," I'll let you out later, so just stay put."
Loid, That geezer actually managed that?! No...
Loid, Who the hell is that?
Loid, Why is it someone else? Did I mess up?!
Loid, Damn it!
Loid, We've got the plate number.
Loid, You're not getting away in that car. Your plan is finished.
Loid, Miss Anya! Miss Anya!
Loid, Did she head back toward the first pet shop? I can't let her be found by the terrorists again! I must catch up to her!
Loid, That's...
Loid, How dare you do that to Miss Anya?! You won't get away this time!
Yor, Miss Anya!
Yor, Miss Anya!
Yor, Did she head back toward
Yor, I can't let her be found
Yor, I must catch up to her!
Yor, That's...
Yor, How dare you do that to Miss Anya?!
Yor, You won't get away this time!
Yor, Your stomachache must have stemmed
Yor," Miss Anya, it's okay! It's okay, Miss Anya!"
Loid, Yor's been coming home late.
Yor," Neither of us dig deeply into the other's private life, so I don't usually ask questions."
Anya," Papa, is it dinner time yet?"
Loid, Once Yor gets home.
Anya," Bond, tell me what we're having for dinner tonight!"
Yor, I'm home.
Yor," A gloomy, somber expression, and... several cuts all over her hands."
Anya," Welcome home, Mama."
Yor," Why, thank you, Miss Anya."
Loid, Welcome home.
Loid, Should we start dinner?
Loid," Oh... I'm not hungry, so you two can go ahead and eat."
Yor, All right...
Loid," Yor, are you..."
Loid, Mama's going to cry? But why?
Yor," If I fail this, I... I might lose those two."

Yor, Great job today.
Camilla," You, too."
Yor, Great job today.
Camilla," Hey, Camilla. Do you wanna go out for some drinks?"
Camilla," Er... Nah, I'm good."
Camilla," Wait, didn't you say you had a date today?"
Camilla, He canceled on me at the last minute.
Camilla, Thank you!
Camilla, Are we really doing this again?
Camilla, Also... Are those tomatoes?! They're clearly crushed! What's wrong with you?!
Camilla," Hey, Yor. You're really serious about this."
Camilla, Thank you for having me over.
Camilla," This is all your fault, by the way! If you hadn't said what you did..."
Yor, YOR'S KITCHEN
Yor, What? You want to learn how to cook?
Yor, Yes!
Yor, My husband was stuck in the bathroom for a whole day because of the breakfast I made the other day!
Camilla," Wow, that sucks."
Yor," At this rate, our marriage is in danger! Meaning my work is in danger!"
Yor, Would any of you kindly be able to teach me?
Camilla, Uh... Er... Our housekeeper makes our food. Go to a class or something.
Anya, I know how to open cans!
Yuri," Heya, what are you girls talking about?"
Camilla," Oh, hey! She's a great cook."
Anya, Hey!
Yor," P-Please, Camilla!"
Camilla, No! Why should I?
Yor," Oh, come on. Teach her."
Camilla," Alrighty, let's meet up at her place."
Yor," Uh, hello?!"
Yor, I look forward to learning even more from you today!
Yor, This is literally the worst.
Yor, Don't be like that.
Camilla," Just so you know, you get to taste all the food again!"
Camilla, The responsibility's yours!
Yor," Oh, about that... I actually invited someone over just for that."
Yuri," Yahoo! Hey, Sis!"
Camilla, I was told that I'd be able to eat your cooking.
Camilla, Um...
Camilla, So this is Yor's little brother?
Yuri," Thank you for having me over, Camilla! And thank you for always looking after my sister!"
Camilla, Uh-huh...
Camilla, So are you having a party of some sort today?
Camilla, What? A cooking class? Don't tell Loid and Miss Anya. I want to secretly get better!
Yor, Curses! She wants to cook for Loidy! Now I'm conflicted!
Yor," Today, I thought I'd try cooking minestrone."
Camilla," Seriously, why do you keep buying things you don't need for this?"
Camilla, What are you even going to use this for?
Yor, I'm sorry. I thought using a variety of ingredients would make it better.
Camilla," Okay, first, peel your potatoes."
Yor, Of course!
Camilla, How does this happen when you're just peeling potatoes?! There's a whole sea of blood! Th-This weapon is just so hard to use!
Camilla, The peeler is not a weapon!
Yuri," Sis, I brought you some bandages!"
Yor," Oh, but I am handy with a knife! I keep telling you that you're cutting it too thin! Just cut it normally!"
Yuri," You're amazing, Sis!"
Camilla," Hello?! Why'd you cut through the cutting board, too?! That was one of my favorites!"
Yor, I'm so sorry! I'll pay for it!
Yuri," You're amazing, Sis!"
Yuri," Seriously, what is wrong with you?! How did you ever get married?"
Camilla, Leave!
Yuri, Who is this woman? She's being rude to my sister. Maybe I'll execute her.
Camilla," Yeah, Yor, you're hopeless. Just give it up. You might as well divorce that hottie."
Yor," Oh, no!"
Yor," Hey, that's a great idea."
Yor," Yes, divorce him, Sis."
Yuri," Please, Camilla!"
Yor," If Loid divorces me, I'll... I'll... I'll have to worry about getting arrested again!"
Camilla, Hurry up and get your ingredients simmering. I'll show you how to season everything as we go along.
Camilla, Hurry up and make the thing so you can go home already.
Camilla, She's actually pretty nice. Just... a bit prickly.
Yor, Camilla has always been a good person.
Yuri," Sis, is there any more?"
Camilla, You weren't ready for minestrone yet.
Camilla," Let's try something easier, like meatballs."
Yuri, Okay!
Yuri," Yum, yum, yum!"
Yuri, It's so good that I'm sweating for unknown reasons!
Yuri," The more I savor each bite, the more I see my life flash before my eyes!"
Yuri," Huh? Is that you over there, Mom?"
Yor," Yuri, stop! You need to stop for a sec!"
Camilla, That's right. Yor and her brother grew up without their parents.
Camilla, I guess your sense of taste got so messed up because this train wreck was the only one eating your food.
Camilla, Train wreck?!
Camilla, Shock.
Camilla, I figured it'd be fine as long as he was getting all the right nutrients.
Yor, Yuri... Thank goodness you grew up healthy.
Camilla, Do you happen to remember anything your parents made for you that was really good?
Yuri, Just curious.
Yuri," Hmm... Do you remember anything, Yuri?"
Yor, Mom's cooking?
Yuri," Hmm... I only remember it vaguely, but didn't she make something like stew often?"
Yuri, That was really warm and yummy.
Camilla, Oh! The one that had the fried egg on top!
Camilla," Okay, let's try making that."
Camilla, Try really hard to remember the taste.
Camilla, It probably uses a simple southern stew base.
Yuri, Whoa!
Yor," Once it comes to a boil, turn off the heat."
Yor, I'm pretty sure it should have paprika powder in it.
Yuri, Right!
Camilla, Make sure it doesn't burn.
Camilla, And use the right amount of salt and pepper.
Yor, Understood!
Camilla," You know, Yor, you seem different now."
Yuri, You seemed more robotic and boring before.
Yor, Huh? Wha? Really?
Yor, P-Perhaps it's because I got married.
Yuri, Huh?
Yuri, What're you humble bragging for?
Camilla, You just changed your makeup a little or something.
Yor," Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!"
Yor," Come on, now. You're a fine, lovely lady yourself, Camilla."
Camilla, Hey!
Camilla," Anyway, this is the first time something's actually smelled good!"
Camilla, I think this one might actually be a success!
Yuri," Hey, it's not bad."
Yuri, It's really good!
Anya, Anya likes this.
Loid, It has quite a soothing taste.
Yor," Huh? What's wrong, Yor?"
Yor," I'm sorry. I just saw your faces, and I think... I was just so relieved."
Yor, I thought I needed to protect this life so that I could continue k*lling.
Yor, But to think that having them acknowledge me... having them smile... would simply... make me this happy.
Yor, I feel a little more confident now... as the wife and mother of the Forger family!
Yor, I'll continue to count on you from now on.
Yor," Oh, right! I actually made one more dish, if you'd like to try it!"
Yor, This is an original dish that I came up with.
Camilla, I'll eat some!
Loid, Why'd you call me out here?
Loid, THE INFORMANT'S GREAT ROMANCE PLAN
Loid, What? Tell you how to have a successful date?
Loid, The secret is hard work. Bye.
Loid," No, no! I was just kidding!"
Loid, Please show this pitiful scruff some mercy!
Twi," So I just need to analyze your potential date and come up with a plan, right?"
Twi, Just shut up and wait a second.
Twi," Okay, done."
Twi, I created a conversational flow chart based on what kind of person she is.
Twi," How am I supposed to do that, you dumbass?!"
Twi, That's tens of thousands of possibilities!
Twi, I guess I could disguise myself and give you instructions from behind—
Twi, Hmm...
Twi, I'll keep you company.
